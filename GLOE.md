## 🧭 Start Here

**Gloē in one line:** the first app a woman opens when she's thinking about Botox, filler, or any aesthetic treatment — to find and book the best deal near her, today. A two-sided marketplace: **consumers** find and buy deals; **vendors** post for free and pay only when a customer actually shows up and redeems.

> 📖 [**HOW-IT-WORKS.md**](./HOW-IT-WORKS.md) is the **founder-readable companion** to this doc — the plain-language, end-to-end tour of how the app *behaves* (how the homepage loads, how trending is computed, how money moves, every edge case, what's not built yet). Same facts as this spec, friendlier voice. Read it when you want to *understand* the app; read this when you want to *build on* it.

### This doc has two readers — every section is written for both

> **📖 How to read any section:** look for the two parts.
> **💼 The pitch** = plain English. What it does, why it matters, where the money is. No code. (For investors — and for *you* remembering why a thing exists.)
> **🔧 Under the hood** = how it's actually built. Files, flow, schema. (For building on it.)

## 1. What Gloē is

### 💼 The pitch

Gloē is the first place a woman looks when she's thinking about Botox, filler, or any aesthetic treatment — an app that shows the **best real deals near her** and lets her book in two taps. Vendors (medspas, injectors, wellness clinics) list deals **for free** and only pay Gloē when a customer **actually shows up and redeems**. Think "Groupon for aesthetics," but curated, mobile-first, and incentive-aligned — we only make money when our vendors do.

**North Star Metric:** monthly redemptions per active consumer. Not downloads, not signups — the moment a voucher gets scanned at the spa. That's a real booking, real money, real value on both sides.

### 🔧 Under the hood

A two-sided marketplace for aesthetic services (Botox, filler, medspa, facials, IV, body, dental, etc.). **Three surfaces, one backend:**
- **Mobile (iOS):** Expo dev-client. Consumer-facing — browse, claim, redeem.
- **Web — vendor portal:** Next.js at `apps/web/src/app/vendor`. Signup, deals, dashboard, scanner.
- **Web — admin (god mode):** Next.js at `apps/web/src/app/admin`. Vendor approval, payouts, fees, audit.
- **API:** Hono + tRPC at `apps/api`. All business logic.

---

## 2. The business model

### 💼 The pitch

**Pay-per-transaction, NOT subscription.** Locked 2026-05-19.

- Consumers browse free, pay full deal price in-app (Apple Pay / card) at claim time.
- Vendors sign up free, post deals free, pay **no monthly anything**.
- Gloē collects payment, holds the funds, and pays the vendor out **on redemption** minus a platform fee.

**Why pay-as-you-earn.** The original $99–199/mo vendor subscription was killed because:

> "If customers just sign up for a subscription and pay but there's not enough clients, they're gonna feel like they're paying for nothing as opposed to you just sign up, you don't pay anything until someone pays."

It aligns incentives (Gloē only makes money when vendors do), kills onboarding friction, and beats Groupon's 30–50% on positioning ("post free, we get paid only when you do").

**Why we win.**
- **Groupon:** takes 30–50% and dilutes the brand. We take ~20% (and we set it) and curate.
- **RealSelf:** review-heavy, deal-light. We're transactional.
- **Instagram ads:** vendors burn $1k+/mo and get nothing trackable. We charge nothing until a real booking lands.
- **UNNI (closest competitor):** validates the market exists. We win on visual polish + breadth.

**Two revenue lines:** (1) the **platform fee** on every sale (~20%, tiered, we set it), and (2) a thin margin on **instant payouts** — vendors who want their money in ~30 min instead of 1–2 days pay Stripe 3%; Stripe's real cost is ~1%, so **Gloē nets ~2%** per instant payout (vendor still sees ~94.7%). Standard ACH payouts stay free.

### 🔧 Under the hood

**The fee schedule is not hardcoded — it's data.** Tiers live in the `platform_fees` table, fully editable in admin (add / edit / deactivate / per-vendor override). `computeFee` reads whatever active rows exist; it never assumes a fixed scheme. Current live config:

| Deal price | Gloē fee |
|---|---|
| $0–$500 | 20% |
| $500+ | flat $60 |

> The active sub-$500 tier currently starts at **$0** (label reads "$100–$499" but `min_cents=0`), so deals under $100 also pay 20%. A setting, not a bug — change it in admin. If `computeFee` finds no matching active tier, it falls back to a safe 12%.

- **Per-vendor override:** a `vendor_id`-scoped tier beats the global one (`ORDER BY is_override DESC`). Forward-only; historical bookings frozen via `platform_fee_snapshot` JSON on `transactions`.
- **Instant payout** is a Stripe Connect pricing scheme (3%) auto-applied to every Instant Payout under the platform. Full money mechanics in §4.

## 3. Architecture

### 💼 The pitch

Three apps — a consumer iPhone app, a vendor website, and an admin "god mode" — all talking to **one brain** (the API) and **one database**. The API decides what *should* happen; Stripe confirms what *did*; webhooks keep the two honest. It's a deliberately boring, proven, type-safe stack chosen so a **solo founder can run the whole business reliably** — not a science project. The whole thing is one codebase (a monorepo), so a change to a rule shows up everywhere at once.

### 🔧 Under the hood

### Mental model

Two-sided marketplace. Three frontends. One API. One DB. The API knows what *should* happen, Stripe knows what *did* — webhooks reconcile.

### Stack (locked)

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Backend language | TypeScript | Type-safety end-to-end with mobile + web |
| API framework | Hono | Light, fast, edge-ready if we need it |
| Type-safe RPC | tRPC | One source of truth for inputs/outputs |
| Database | Postgres (Supabase) | PostGIS for geo, RLS for auth-at-DB |
| Mobile | Expo (React Native), dev-client | iOS-first; dev-client (not Expo Go) due to native modules. Reanimated + Gesture Handler; Google Fonts (Fraunces/Inter/Outfit) |
| Web | Next.js (App Router) | Consumer marketplace + vendor portal + admin god-mode; shared with mobile via packages/ |
| UI | RN primitives (mobile) · plain CSS — `globals.css` brand tokens + inline styles (web) | No CSS framework; shared brand tokens/wordmark/fonts live in `packages/ui`. (No Tamagui — earlier plan, never adopted.) |
| Data fetching | TanStack Query + tRPC client | `@gloe/api-client` wraps the tRPC router for both apps |
| Auth | Clerk | Email + Google/Facebook/TikTok social (Apple pending — GLO-9); headless on mobile (`@clerk/clerk-expo`), `<SignIn/>` on web |
| Payments | Stripe Connect (Express) | KYC, payouts, 1099-K, transfers + dispute/clawback all handled |
| Transactional email | Resend + React Email | `sendEmail()` single door; branded templates in `apps/api/src/emails` (receipts, refunds, expiry reminders). Auth emails are Clerk's, separate |
| Push | APNs direct (HTTP/2 + ES256 JWT) | No Expo push proxy in the loop; DB-driven notification registry + queue + cron |
| Deploy | Railway | API + web; auto-deploy on `main`; envs in dashboard |
| Storage | Supabase Storage | Photos + videos; pre-signed uploads |
| Maps / geo | Google Maps + PostGIS | Vendor geocoding, distance, drive-time estimate |
| Project mgmt | Linear | The "Gloē" project; GLO-* tickets are the living backlog |

### Repo layout

### API domain modules (`apps/api/src/domain/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `admin.ts` | God mode queries — vendor roster, deal review, payout release, audit. |

| `audit.ts` | Audit log writer. Every money + vendor action logged. |
| `checkout.ts` | `createPurchase()` — validates deal/variant, computes fee, creates PaymentIntent, records pending txn. |
| `claims.ts` | Voucher lifecycle — create on payment, redeem on scan, expire on cron. Snapshot freeze. QR + human code. |
| `dealCreate.ts` | Deal + variant + photo + video insert. Draft vs. pending_review. |
| `dealMap.ts` | Google Static Maps cache for redemption location. |
| `deals.ts` | Deal queries — list, search, filter, expire elapsed. Drive-time estimate via straight-line + tiered mph. |
| `devices.ts` | Device token store. Upsert on launch, delete on APNs 410. |
| `fees.ts` | Platform fee tier logic. Per-vendor override. |
| `googleMaps.ts` | Places autocomplete + place details. |
| `payouts.ts` | `releaseTransferForClaim()` — 11 routing walls before sending vendor share. Instant payout eligibility. |
| `payoutWebhooks.ts` | Stripe payout.* webhook handler. Mirrors to payouts table. |
| `reviews.ts` | Deal reviews — list, create, vendor response. |
| `saved.ts` | Saved deals + vendors. |
| `stripe.ts` | Single seam to Stripe SDK. PaymentIntent, Transfer, Checkout, Connect onboarding. |
| `vendorHub.ts` | Vendor dashboard data — sold today, redeemed, held balance, etc. |
| `vendorOps.ts` | Vendor lifecycle — refund txn, wind-down vendor, reverse transfers. |
| `vendorSignup.ts` | Vendor creation + Stripe account ID + tier. |
| `vendorStorefront.ts` | Public vendor profile + storefront feed. |
| `vendorStripe.ts` | Stripe onboarding + dashboard link generation. |
| `walletPass.ts` | Apple Wallet pass generation. PassKit signing. |
| `walletPassArt.ts` | Dynamic pass background art. |

### Why no microservices

Single Node API + direct SQL for dashboards + webhooks direct to DB + polling for "live" UIs + one repo. When each breaks: add a load balancer, materialize views, buffer to a queue, switch to WebSockets, enforce ownership instead of splitting.

## 4. The money pipeline

### 💼 The pitch

How money actually moves, in plain English: the customer pays Gloē up front; we **hold** the cash; when she actually shows up and **redeems**, we release the vendor's share (minus our fee) to their Stripe account, and Stripe pays it to their bank. The vendor only gets paid for **real, completed** bookings — that's the entire promise, and it's also our fraud protection. We never touch raw card details (Stripe does), and the API and Stripe webhooks constantly cross-check each other so money can't silently go missing.

### 🔧 Under the hood

### TL;DR — four stages

1. **Charge.** Customer pays $200 → lands on Gloē's platform balance (PaymentIntent, no `transfer_data`).
2. **Transfer.** Customer redeems → Gloē moves $160 to vendor's Connect account (Stripe Transfer). *(20% fee = $40 stays on platform; at current live rates.)*
3. **Payout.** Stripe runs daily ACH → vendor bank gets $160 in 1–2 days. Free.
3'. **Instant payout** *(optional).* Vendor taps "pay me now" → ~30 min to debit card. 3% fee taken by Stripe pricing scheme; Gloē nets ~2%.

### Stage 1 — Charge

```
PaymentIntent.create({
  amount: 20000,           // $200 in cents
  // NO transfer_data — money stays on Gloē's balance
  metadata: { dealId, variantId, vendorId, userId, quantity }
})
```

- `transactions` row inserted with `status='pending_payment'`, fee snapshot frozen as JSON.
- Webhook `payment_intent.succeeded` flips to `paid` + fires `fulfillPurchase()` → creates N claims (one per voucher).

### Stage 2 — Transfer (on redemption)

```
releaseTransferForClaim(claimId)
  ├─ wall: claim exists + status='redeemed'
  ├─ wall: txn exists + status='paid'
  ├─ wall: vendor stripe_account_status='active'
  ├─ wall: caller is vendor (auth) — NEVER trust caller's vendor_id
  ├─ wall: idempotency key
  ├─ wall: sanity cap ($1K auto-routes to review on launch)
  └─ Transfer.create({ amount: vendor_payout_cents, destination: vendor.stripe_account_id })
```

- Stripe knows nothing about the platform fee — we just transfer less.
- Transfer is idempotent at Stripe layer via key `transfer_for_claim_${claimId}`.
- Transaction.stripe_transfer_id set; audit log written.
- Default: auto-release with 24h hold (tunable per vendor). Manual review mode for first ~50 live redemptions before flipping global auto.

### Stage 3 — Standard payout

- Stripe runs scheduled ACH (vendor's chosen `payout_schedule`).
- Webhooks fire: `payout.created` → `payout.paid` (or `payout.failed`).
- `payoutWebhooks.ts` mirrors to our `payouts` table. Idempotent via `stripe_payout_id` unique.
- Gloē **does not trigger** standard payouts. Stripe owns the cadence.

### Stage 3' — Instant payout

- Vendor taps "Pay me now." Eligibility: `payouts_enabled=true` + debit card on file.
- `createInstantPayout()` calls Stripe with `method='instant'`.
- Stripe deducts 3% **application fee** (configured as pricing scheme in Stripe Dashboard).
- Stripe's cost ~1%, so Gloē nets ~2%.
- Same payout webhook handlers as standard.

### Refunds

**Pre-redemption (simple):**
- Admin clicks Refund → `refundPaymentIntent()` → money goes back to customer's card.
- Vendor was never paid; no clawback needed.
- Claim flips to `cancelled`.

**Post-redemption (hard, requires vendor consent):**
- `reverseTransferForClaim()` → `transfers.createReversal()` on the Stripe Transfer.
- Then `refundPaymentIntent()` on the original charge.
- Vendor's connected-account balance debited; we should not do this without their signed agreement.

### Disputes & chargebacks (SHIPPED — GLO-34)

`charge.dispute.created`, `.updated`, and `.closed` are handled in `payoutWebhooks.ts` (`handleStripeDisputeWebhook`), wired from the `/webhooks/stripe` router. Disputes on platform charges fire on the platform account (no `event.account`), so we resolve the transaction directly from the dispute's `payment_intent`. **Register all three events in both the test and live Stripe webhook endpoints** — the code is inert without them.

**On `charge.dispute.created`:**

1. **Freeze the voucher** — every still-`active` claim on the transaction flips to the `frozen` status (added to `claims_status_check`). Redemption is gated on `status='active'`, so a frozen voucher cannot be redeemed; the vendor scanner shows *"on hold pending a payment review."*
2. **Halt the payout** — `transactions.status='disputed'` (+ `stripe_dispute_id`, `dispute_status`, `dispute_reason`, `disputed_at`). This is **wall #12**: `releaseTransferForClaim()` already refuses unless the transaction is `paid`, so no transfer can fire while disputed. (We also backfill `stripe_charge_id` here.)
3. **Already-redeemed case** — if a claim on the order was already `redeemed`, we can't un-deliver it; the audit row uses `dispute.opened_redeemed` and sets `needsAdminReview` so god mode surfaces it.

**On `charge.dispute.closed`:**

- **Won** (`status='won`') → reverse the freeze: `frozen` claims go back to `active`, the transaction back to `paid` (so it can pay out). Audit: `dispute.won`.
- **Lost** → the freeze stands and the transaction remains `disputed`. What happens to the money depends on the vendor's auto-clawback flag (below). Audit: `dispute.lost`.

**Two separate money moves — Stripe does one, we do the other.** On a lost dispute Stripe **automatically** pulls the full charge **back from the platform balance** and returns it to the cardholder (the customer refund — we do nothing). But Stripe does **not** touch the vendor's already-sent transfer. Since our flow is charge-lands-on-platform → transfer-to-vendor-on-redemption, the platform just lost the *whole* charge while the vendor still holds their share. The vendor claw-back is the only money left for us to move, and it's on us.

**Auto-clawback on a lost dispute (per-vendor, ON by default).** `vendors.auto_clawback_on_dispute_lost` (default `true` for every vendor; toggle on the vendor detail page → Disputes card, audit `vendor.auto_clawback.set`). When a `dispute.lost` webhook fires AND the vendor was already paid (a transfer exists):
  - **Flag ON** → the webhook calls `reconcileLostDispute(sql, txnId, null)` automatically (post-commit, `actorUserId=null` ⇒ system). It reverses the vendor's transfer via `transfers.createReversal` — which can push their Connect balance negative; Stripe recoups it from their future sales (that's how we actually recover). Audit `dispute.reconciled` with `auto: true`.
  - **Flag OFF** → no auto-reversal; the `dispute.lost` audit sets `needsAdminReview: true` and an owner clicks **"Claw back vendor share"** (`admin.reconcileLostDispute`) in the transaction drawer's dispute panel.
  Either path deliberately **skips `refunds.create`** — the chargeback already returned the customer's money, so a second refund would double-pay.

**Vendor chargeback liability is contractual (SHIPPED — GLO-35).** The **Vendor Agreement** at `/legal/vendor-terms` makes the claw-back defensible: Gloē is a marketplace facilitator, the vendor is merchant of record, dispute liability (amount + dispute fee) sits with the vendor, Gloē may reverse transfers / withhold or offset future payouts, and the platform fee is retained on refunded/disputed transactions. Vendors accept it via a **required checkbox at signup** — enforced server-side in `vendor.signup` and stamped on the vendor row (`terms_accepted_at`, `terms_version`; version constant `VENDOR_TERMS_VERSION` in `vendorSignup.ts`). Admin-pre-created (unclaimed) vendors have no stamp yet — capturing acceptance at claim time is a noted follow-up. Counsel review of all legal pages remains GLO-15.

**Repeat-offender flag.** Disputes are tracked per vendor. God mode paints a red **⚠ high dispute rate** flag on the Vendors list + a vendor's detail page (a "Disputes" scorecard: in-window / all-time / open / lost / rate) when they cross an **admin-set threshold**. The line is yours to draw — `Settings → Dispute-risk flag` (a toggle + "more than N disputes in the last D days", stored in `platform_settings`: `dispute_risk_enabled` / `dispute_risk_max` / `dispute_risk_window_days`; see `getDisputeRiskConfig`). It only flags — it never auto-suspends; you decide whether to wind the vendor down. A **⚠ Flagged** filter chip on the Vendors list (GLO-36) shows only over-threshold vendors, so the slash-list is one tap instead of eyeballing the column.

### Reconciliation

- `reconcileVendorTransfers()` (admin router) queries Stripe transfers and diffs against our DB. Manually triggered today; cron-friendly.
- Run nightly once live volume justifies.

### State machines

```
transactions:    pending_payment → paid → released  →  refunded  or  partially_refunded
                                       ↘ (vendor never onboarded → stays paid, money held)
                                       ↘ disputed (charge.dispute.created) → paid (won) | stays disputed (lost)

claims:          active → redeemed   →  (transfer fires)
                       ↘ expired   (cron, past expires_at) → admin reissue spawns a NEW
                                     active claim (fresh codes + expiry, linked via
                                     reissued_from_claim_id; no new charge, no spots bump)
                       ↘ cancelled (refund pre-redemption)
                       ↘ frozen    (dispute opened) → active (dispute won)

payouts:         pending → paid
                        ↘ failed
                        ↘ cancelled
```

### Walls (every transfer passes all)

1. Auth — caller must be vendor owner OR admin
2. Routing — derive vendor account server-side, never trust input
3. Claim status — must be `redeemed`
4. Transaction status — must be `paid`
5. Vendor Stripe status — must be `active`
6. Idempotency — Stripe key `transfer_for_claim_${claimId}`
7. Sanity cap — $1K+ auto-routes to admin review at launch (remove later)
8. Hold window — default 24h post-redemption (per-vendor tunable)
9. Vendor not suspended
10. Stripe account `payouts_enabled=true`
11. License on file (GLO-19: admin-verified via the license review flow; enforced at posting time through `canPostDeals`)
12. No open dispute on the transaction — a `charge.dispute.created` sets the transaction to `disputed`, and wall #4 (`status='paid'`) refuses it. The dispute also freezes the voucher (wall #3 can never reach `redeemed`). See §4 Disputes.

### Deal promos — "Extra $X off" (GLO-44)

A **promo** is a public discount placed ON a deal (not a code, not wallet money): everyone browsing sees the badge — auto copy "Extra $15 off" or a custom label — and the discount applies itself as a line item at checkout, **before** credits. One live promo per deal (DB-enforced), window-bound (`starts_at`/`ends_at`), table `deal_promos`. Distinct from credits (GLO-24): credits follow the *customer*; promos sit on the *deal*.

**Funding decides the payout math** (the part that must not be wrong):

| | Platform-funded (god mode) | Vendor-funded ("Boost this deal") |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Customer pays | price − promo | price − promo |
| Fee computed on | **original price** | **discounted price** |
| Vendor receives | original − fee(original) — **vendor stays whole** | discounted − fee(discounted) |
| Who eats it | Gloē (comes out of the platform fee; same balance-funded plumbing as credits) | The vendor (their dashboard shows "you'll receive $X instead of $Y" before they confirm) |

On the transaction row: `deal_promo_id`, `promo_discount_cents`, `promo_funded_by`. For platform-funded promos `consumer_paid_cents` stays the FULL price (the credits pattern — only the Stripe charge shrinks); for vendor-funded ones the sale is booked at the discounted price, so everything downstream (fee snapshot, payout, refunds, disputes) just works.

**Stacking & guards:** promo first, credits on the remainder; earn rules (referral floor) evaluate on the post-promo total. Promo can't push any variant below Stripe's 50¢ floor, can't exceed a 90% total discount vs the original price (FTC pricing-claims hygiene), and never stacks with another promo. Paused/suspended deals take their promo off-air automatically (the lookup requires `deals.status='active'`).

**Refunds:** the customer gets back what they *paid* (cash + credits — never the discount). Vendor-funded → the proportional clawback restores the vendor's discounted share; platform-funded → the platform absorbs its promo share, as it already did at sale time.

**Surfaces:** badge takes the card's top-left slot (promo > Sponsored > "% off" — never stacked) with the post-promo price in the price row on app + web; its own line above credits at checkout; receipts show original / promo / credits / charged. God mode → **Promos** tab (create platform-funded, cost-to-date = orders × recorded discount, end any promo). Vendor dashboard → **Boost** on a live deal (vendor-funded, payout preview, end anytime). Audit: `deal_promo.created` / `deal_promo.ended`.

## 5. Database schema

### 💼 The pitch

The single source of record for the whole business — every vendor and customer, every deal, every voucher, every dollar in and out. It's Postgres (battle-tested), with **geography built in** (so "deals near me" is fast and exact) and **security enforced at the database itself** — a customer literally cannot query another customer's data even if the app had a bug. Boring and bulletproof on purpose; this is the money layer.

### 🔧 Under the hood

All tables in Supabase Postgres. PostGIS extension on. RLS enabled (auth at DB layer).

### Core tables

| Table | Purpose | Key columns |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | Consumer accounts (Clerk-backed) | clerk_user_id, email, phone, name, deleted_at (soft-delete tombstone for account deletion) |
| `vendors` | Practice accounts | id, owner_user_id, business_name, stripe_account_id, stripe_account_status, auto_release_on_redemption, suspended, percentage_fee_override, license_number/state/type, license_status (unverified/pending_review/verified/rejected), license_document_path (private bucket), license_submitted/reviewed_at, license_rejection_reason |
| `deals` | Listings | id, vendor_id, title, description, status (draft/pending_review/active/expired), category_id, secondary_category_id, redemption_address, redemption_lat/lng, fine_print, restrictions |
| `deal_variants` | Per-deal options | deal_id, label, unit_count, unit_label, original_price_cents, deal_price_cents, spots_total, spots_claimed |
| `deal_photos` | Deal imagery | deal_id, url, display_order |
| `deal_videos` | Deal video | deal_id, url, thumbnail_url, caption, duration_seconds |
| `claims` | Vouchers | id, user_id, deal_id, variant_id, vendor_id, status (active/redeemed/expired/cancelled/frozen), qr_payload, human_code, expires_at, redeemed_at, snapshot (frozen metadata JSON), reissued_from_claim_id (set on admin-reissued replacements; unique partial index = one reissue per voucher) |
| `transactions` | Money records | id, vendor_id, user_id, consumer_paid_cents, vendor_payout_cents, platform_fee_cents, status, stripe_payment_intent_id, stripe_charge_id, stripe_transfer_id, platform_fee_snapshot (JSON), refunded_cents, stripe_dispute_id, dispute_status, dispute_reason, disputed_at, dispute_resolved_at |
| `payouts` | Stripe payouts mirror | id, vendor_id, stripe_payout_id, amount_cents, status, arrival_estimate_at, arrived_at, failure_message |
| `platform_fees` | Fee tiers (admin-editable) | label, min_cents, max_cents, percent_bps, flat_cents, min_fee_cents, vendor_id (null=global, set=override), active |
| `device_tokens` | iOS push targets | user_id, platform, token, last_seen_at |
| `notification_types` | Push registry (one row per type) | key, label, enabled, delay_minutes, title_template, body_template, thread_id |
| `notification_queue` | Pending delayed pushes (cron drains) | type_key, user_id, vars, data, dedup_key, send_after, sent_at, skipped_reason |
| `pass_registrations` | Apple Wallet pass devices | device_library_identifier, pass_type_identifier, serial_number (=claim.id), push_token, authentication_token |
| `audit_log` | Every mutation | action, actor_id, resource_ids (JSON), meta (JSON), created_at |
| `reviews` | Deal reviews | id, deal_id, author_id, rating, comment, vendor_response |
| `review_photos` | Review imagery | review_id, url, display_order |
| `saved_deals` | Favorited deals | user_id, deal_id |
| `saved_vendors` | Favorited vendors | user_id, vendor_id |
| `service_categories` / `service_subtypes` | Service taxonomy (8 categories → ~128 treatments; god-mode editable in Admin → Treatments) | slug, display_name, icon, is_unit_based, unit_label, helper_text, display_order, active |
| `support_tickets` | Concierge cases (consumer ↔ Gloē) | id, user_id, subject, category, status (open/awaiting_us/awaiting_customer/resolved/closed), last_message_at, resolved_at |
| `support_messages` | Ticket thread messages | id, ticket_id, sender_type (customer/agent/system), sender_user_id, body, read_at |
| `support_message_attachments` | Photo/video on a message | id, message_id, kind (image/video), url, thumbnail_url, width, height, display_order |
| `region_waitlist` | Out-of-area demand capture | email (unique), city_label, lat, lng |
| `message_threads` / `messages` | **DEAD** — vendor↔consumer scaffolding, 0 rows, unused. Not the support tables. |

### Storage buckets (Supabase Storage)

Public: `deal-photos`, `deal-videos`, `deal-maps`, `review-photos`, `support-attachments`, `org-assets`. **Private:** `license-docs` (GLO-19 — license documents are PII; no public URLs, admins read via short-lived signed URLs from `createSignedReadUrl`). Signed uploads via `createSignedUpload(ownerId, fileExt, kind)` in `db/storage.ts` — the `BUCKETS` map keys: photo/video/review/support/license. Public URLs stored on the row (private buckets store the `path` instead); paths are unguessable UUIDs.

### Migration tracking

The full schema history (38 migrations from the `drop_all_legacy_tables` reset forward) is tracked in `supabase/migrations/`. **Going forward, every schema change gets a file there in the same PR.** Note: the latest tables (`support_*`, `region_waitlist`, `users.deleted_at`) were applied directly via the Supabase MCP and are live, but a few of those migration files may still need backfilling into `supabase/migrations/` — verify before relying on a from-zero rebuild.

### Service taxonomy (8 live categories → ~128 treatments)

Two tables are the spine of the marketplace — `service_categories` → `service_subtypes` — and **the DB is the source of truth** (vendor signup chips, deal-form treatment picker, Discover pills, and search all read it live):

1. **Injectables** (unit-based) — tox brands, every major filler line, lip/cheek/jawline/under-eye, Kybella, PDO threads, filler dissolving… (33)
2. **Skin** — facials (Hydrafacial, DiamondGlow, Glo2Facial…), dermaplaning, peels (VI, Jessner, BioRePeel), microneedling (+PRP, Vivace, Potenza, Morpheus8), LED, plasma fibroblast… (25)
3. **Laser** — BBL/IPL, HALO, Moxi, CO2/CoolPeel, Fraxel, Clear+Brilliant, Pico, Vbeam, laser hair, tattoo removal… (14)
4. **Weight Loss** — program, lipo/MIC-B12 shots, InBody, phentermine; *semaglutide/tirzepatide rows exist but are deactivated* (toggle in god mode)
5. **Body & Contouring** — CoolSculpting, Emsculpt NEO, truSculpt, SculpSure, cellulite, Emsella, lymphatic… (10)
6. **IV Therapy** (`wellness`) — NAD+, Myers, glutathione, vitamin C, immunity/beauty/energy/hangover/recovery drips, shots… (14)
7. **Hormones & Peptides** — BHRT, TRT, pellets, peptide therapy (sermorelin, BPC-157), consult+labs (7)
8. **Lashes & Eyes** (`other`) — extensions, fills, lift & tint, brow lamination/tint, microblading, powder brows, permanent eyeliner, Latisse, Upneeq (10)

(+ a hidden legacy `beauty` category — spray tans, teeth whitening etc., all inactive.)

**Edited in god mode — Admin → Treatments** (`TaxonomyView.tsx`, `admin.listTaxonomy/createSubtype/updateSubtype/deleteSubtype/reorderSubtypes/updateCategory`). Add, rename, set unit label, reorder, hide/restore; categories can be renamed/hidden too. "Remove" is **soft** (deals keep their tag; the chip vanishes from every picker and from search); hard delete only for treatments no deal ever used. Every change is audit-logged (`taxonomy.*`). A new treatment is **instantly searchable** — search matches subtype display names directly in SQL — without touching the synonym file (that only adds slang like "fat freeze" → CoolSculpting).

## 6. Consumer app

### 💼 The pitch

The iPhone app a customer actually uses: **find** a deal (Discover + Search), **save** favorites, **buy and store** her voucher (Wallet), and manage her account + reach support (Profile). Designed to feel premium and get a first-timer from "curious about Botox" to "booked" in well under a minute. Individual features have their own deep-dives — §6A search, §6B pay, §6C Apple Wallet, §6D notifications, §6E the tab bar.

### 🔧 Under the hood

### Tabs

| Tab | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Discover | Shipped | Feed of deals near you. **Admin-authored editorial section rails** (cute taglines that pool 1..N categories, GLO-27) — falls back to per-category rails when none authored. 4:3 cards each ending in an inline "See all" tile → 2-up grid; per-category Browse tiles; filter pills; location-gated home (§6A). |
| Map | Shipped | ResortPass-style map discovery (GLO-25). Reached via the brand map button by the search bar. Full detail in §6A → "Map discovery". |
| Saved | Shipped | Bookmarked deals + vendors. Segmented control. |
| Wallet | Shipped | Active vouchers, past claims, soonest-expiring hero, live credit balance + ledger history (GLO-24). |
| Profile | Shipped | Grouped settings (ACTIVITY / PREFERENCES / SUPPORT & ABOUT), sign out, delete account (SHIPPED). See "Profile screen" below. |

### Key flows

**Onboarding (3 screens max):**
- Splash → location ask (contextual, on first "Near me" tap, not cold) → optional sign-in. No paywall.
- Anonymous browse OK. Sign-in required only at claim time.

**Deal detail flow:**
- `app/(app)/deal/[id].tsx`
- Hero image, vendor card, variant picker, reviews, redemption map, restrictions, fine print
- "Claim" CTA → Stripe payment sheet → success → voucher screen.

**Voucher screen (`my-deal/[id].tsx`):**
- Three visual states: active, redeemed, expired.
- QR code (generated client-side via `react-native-qrcode-svg`), human-readable 6-digit code, expires countdown.
- Vendor live info fetched fresh (phone, address).
- "Add to Apple Wallet" badge.
- Share button (sends gift link via `createGiftLink`).
- **Redemption is vendor-only.** The customer screen only *displays* the QR + code; the vendor scans/enters it in their scanner to redeem. There is no consumer self-redeem button or mutation — a "Simulate redemption" button + the `devMarkRedeemed` path were removed 2026-05-29 because they could fire a payout with no one showing up.

**Search:** ✅ **Built** — `app/(app)/search.tsx` is the live fuzzy/synonym-aware search; `deals.search` / `deals.suggest` / `deals.trending` / `deals.detectSubtype` / `deals.categoryTreatments` back it. Full breakdown in **§6A**.

**Location gate (GLO-26):** Home stays pristine — location is handled invisibly. `SelectedLocationProvider` has a real **unset** state (`hasLocation`): on launch it lights up only from an already-granted GPS fix (no cold-start permission nag), and the San Diego coords are demoted to a neutral *map camera*, never surfaced as "your location." When `hasLocation` is false, the Discover All view is replaced by a full-screen `LocationGate` ("See med-spa deals near you → Use my location"); granted → real feed with **minimal location chrome**, denied/blocked → the city picker. Once located, the city you're browsing is folded **into the `SearchBar` itself** as a tappable left segment (pin + truncated city, `maxWidth: 132`, hairline `border.subtle` divider, then the cycling "Search …" placeholder) — it's both the "where am I searching?" answer (the city is shown, not hidden behind an icon) and the "change it" affordance (GLO-26 AC #5). The segment fires `onPressLocation` → `LocationPickerSheet` (held by `discover.tsx`); the rest of the bar fires `onPress` → search screen — two tap targets, one control. It only renders when `hasLocation` is true (the unset state is owned by the gate). We tried two standalone placements first and rejected both: a pill *inside* the search row collided with the cycling placeholder on long city names, and a pill on its *own line* floated alone leaving dead horizontal space. Folding it into the one search control (ResortPass/Airbnb pattern) is what reads clean. The old chevron'd `LocationPill` is kept but unmounted. Changing location is also still reachable from **Map + Search** — on the map it's an elevated pin'd pill (pin + city + chevron) next to the back button, matching the home segment, → same `LocationPickerSheet`. The home header carries no sign-in link (Profile tab + auth-gate cover sign-in). `LocationPickerSheet` offers three ways in: a **live-autocompleting address/city search**, a **"Use my current location"** GPS row, and the curated `POPULAR_CITIES` list.

**Picker autocomplete (Google Places).** As you type (debounced 250ms, 3-char min), suggestions populate live from Google Places Autocomplete via our **`geocode.autocomplete`** tRPC endpoint (`types: 'geocode'` so plain city names match alongside full addresses; key stays server-side in `apps/api/src/domain/googleMaps.ts` — the single Google seam). Tapping a suggestion resolves its `placeId` → coords + a clean "City, ST" label via **`geocode.placeDetails`**, then sets it like any picked city. **Cost guardrail:** GPS and the popular-cities list are Google-free; only *typing* a search hits Google. At ≤~5k active users this sits inside Google's $200/mo free credit. `TODO(~10k+ users)`: thread a Places `sessiontoken` through autocomplete→placeDetails so a typing session bills as one unit, and set a Cloud billing alert.

**Out-of-area ("coming soon") gate:**
- We launch in LA / Orange County / San Diego. When a **located** user's area has **zero deals within 50mi** (no category/filter active), Discover shows `ComingSoon` instead of an empty grid. (Distinct from the location gate above: that's "we don't know where you are"; this is "we know, but we're not there yet".)
- The gate is **data-driven, not a hardcoded boundary**: the moment a new city gets its first live deal, the next nearby user sees a feed automatically — no deploy, no flag. "The listing unlocks the gate."
- The screen lists the cities that are **actually live** (`waitlist.liveCities` → distinct cities with active deals), so the "Now live in …" copy is never stale even with multiple cities open.
- Email capture (`waitlist.join`, public) stores `{email, city_label, lat, lng}` in `region_waitlist` (upsert on email). No notification fires yet — this is demand collection. Admin god-mode **Waitlist** tab (`WaitlistView`) shows demand ranked by city = the expansion roadmap.
- **"Explore a live city"** row opens the shared `LocationPickerSheet` so out-of-area users can enter an address or tap a live city and see how Gloē works; picking a city with deals re-fires the feed and `ComingSoon` falls away. A blunter "Browse SoCal deals" escape hatch also drops them into the SD-default feed.

**In-app support tickets (consumer ↔ Gloē):**
- Profile → **Concierge** opens `support/cases.tsx` (list of cases + new request) → `support/[id].tsx` (chat thread). Customer opens a case, sees ongoing cases in chat format, replies inline.
- Backend: `support_tickets` + `support_messages` tables (purpose-built — NOT the dead vendor-shaped `message_threads`). 5-state machine: `open → awaiting_us → awaiting_customer → resolved → closed`. `domain/supportTickets.ts` (consumer, all `userId`-scoped, IDOR-guarded) + `support.router.ts`.
- God mode: **Support** tab (`SupportView.tsx`) lists tickets `awaiting_us`-first (triage queue) with a reply drawer. Agent reply is the ONLY place an APNs push fires (`createAgentReply` in `admin.ts` → `sendApnsPushToUser`, fire-and-forget, `data:{type:'support_reply',ticketId}` read flat on device).
- Push-on-reply + a **permission-aware** caption above the composer: "You can close the app — we'll notify you the moment we reply" (granted) vs a "turn on notifications" prompt (denied). Notification tap deep-links to the thread via a listener in `usePushRegistration.ts`.
- **Outbound email is live via Resend** (`domain/email.ts` → `sendEmail()`, the single send door — no-ops if `RESEND_API_KEY` unset, never throws into the caller; React Email templates in `src/emails/`; recipient = user email, payer-email fallback for gift links). Sending domain `mail.gloe.app` (DKIM/SPF/DMARC verified); from `receipts@mail.gloe.app`, reply-to `support@gloe.app`. Resend stays in **testing mode** (verified-addresses-only) until toggled to production at launch. Every template sets a preheader (`<Preview>` in `BaseLayout`) that **complements the subject instead of repeating it** (code + expiry on receipts, refund timing, reply excerpt on support) — inbox list views show subject and preview side by side, so duplicates read as a glitch. **Emails wired so far:**
  - **Receipt** (GLO-37) — fires on fulfillment (`fulfillPurchase`, fire-and-forget post-commit, idempotent). Deal hero banner (omitted if the photo URL doesn't 200 — no broken `<img>`) + voucher code(s) + "how to pull up your QR" (Wallet tab on mobile, `gloe.app/wallet` on web).
  - **Refund confirmation** (GLO-38) — fires from BOTH `refundTransaction` (pre-redemption) and `forceRefundRedeemed` (post-redemption/dispute) via `sendRefundEmail()`; amount, full-vs-partial, 5–10 business-day note.
  - **Voucher-expiring reminder** (GLO-39) — `sendExpiryReminders()` daily sweep in `index.ts` finds active unredeemed claims expiring within 7 days, emails once, dedups via `claims.expiry_reminded_at` (expiry is lazy, so the sweep is what nudges).
  - **Welcome** (GLO-28) — `sendWelcomeEmail()` fires from the just-in-time user insert in `context/auth.ts` (first verified token → user row created → email), so it sends exactly once per signup, never on login; Resend idempotency key `welcome:<clerkUserId>` guards the double-insert race. Fully **static** by design (no listings/prices — freshness lives behind the CTA); locked "Curation" copy, premium tone, the word "deals" absent; single CTA "Explore treatments near you →" → location-aware discover page (web root; swap to GLO-14 Universal Link when live). First name from Clerk with "Welcome to Gloē." fallback. Template `WelcomeEmail.tsx`.
  - **Vendor payout notice** (GLO-40) — `sendVendorPayoutEmail()` fires from `payouts.ts` right after `transfer.created`: amount + deal title + "View in Stripe" CTA, to the owner's email (vendor business email fallback), idempotency key `payout:<transferId>` (one per transfer regardless of retries). Template `PayoutEmail.tsx`.
  - **Support reply** (GLO-40) — `sendSupportReplyEmail()` fires from `createAgentReply` alongside the push: **includes the agent's full reply text** (Ryan's call) + "continue in Profile → Support", idempotency key `support-reply:<messageId>`. Template `SupportReplyEmail.tsx`.
  Still pending: gift-link confirmation (GLO-17); vendor-invite email is Clerk's invitation (GLO-5); auth emails are Clerk's (GLO-18). No inbound parsing yet. Account deletion CASCADEs tickets+messages (PII).
- Also fixed in this work: `device_tokens` RLS was DISABLED (a pre-existing hole) — now enabled with owner policies.

**Concierge attachments (photos + videos):**
- Customers attach images/videos to any support message — via **camera** or **library**, chosen from a branded bottom sheet (`AttachmentSheet.tsx`, not the dated `ActionSheetIOS`). `useSupportUpload.ts` handles pick/capture → signed upload → public URL.
- Rendered inline in the mobile chat (`MessageAttachments.tsx`, images tappable to full-screen, videos with play) AND in god mode (`SupportView.tsx` renders consumer media; admin reply is text-only for v1).
- Backend: `support_message_attachments` table + `support-attachments` bucket. `support.signAttachmentUpload` (consumer) + `admin.signSupportAttachmentUpload` (god mode). `create`/`reply` accept an `attachments[]`; a body-or-attachment refine lets a photo-only message through.
- iOS: `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` + `NSCameraUsageDescription` + `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in Info.plist (the missing photo key was hard-crashing the picker).
- **Watch-out:** the batched attachment fetch uses `ANY(...)::uuid[]` — the `::uuid[]` cast is required (postgres.js `sql.array()` yields `text[]`; without the cast the query throws and the router masked it as a bogus NOT_FOUND/"couldn't open conversation"). The getCase catch now surfaces non-NOT_FOUND errors as 500 instead of hiding them.

### Profile screen (`app/(app)/(tabs)/profile.tsx`) — SHIPPED

Account hub. Header (avatar/stats when signed in, or the sign-up/sign-in card when out), then settings grouped **by intent** rather than one flat list — the grouping is what tells the user where to look:

- **ACTIVITY** (signed-in only) — your stuff *inside* the app: Your deals (with a live active-claims count badge), My receipts & vouchers.
- **PREFERENCES** — things you tune: Appearance (in-app), Notifications + Location settings (deep-link to iOS Settings → Gloe; in-app toggles would be fake controls that just call `openSettings()` anyway).
- **SUPPORT & ABOUT** — the help/legal/footer cluster: **Concierge**, Contact info (mailto), Rate Gloē, Terms & privacy, About Gloē (shows version). **Concierge sits here, not in ACTIVITY, so it's reachable even signed-out** — the likeliest reason someone digs through Profile while logged out is they're stuck and need help (the ticket flow can prompt sign-in at send time).

Each group is its own card via one shared `SettingsGroup` renderer (no copy-paste). Rows carry an optional `badge` (count) and an `external` flag that picks the trailing icon.

**Icon seam (cohesion rule):** trailing indicators use the central `features/icon/Icon.tsx` Lucide seam — `chevronRight` for in-app navigation, `arrowUpRight` for "opens externally". Never raw Unicode glyphs: bare `↗`/`›` text was being auto-promoted by iOS to a full-color emoji (ignoring tone), which is why these are real SVG icons. All app icons go through this seam so the library can be swapped in one file.

### Account deletion (Apple 5.1.1(v)) — SHIPPED

`me.deleteAccount` (`domain/account.ts`). **Anonymize-and-deactivate, not hard delete** — `transactions.user_id` is FK-RESTRICT, so financial/tax records must survive. It: deletes the Clerk identity → scrubs PII → tombstones `clerk_user_id` (`deleted:<uuid>`) → sets `users.deleted_at`. CASCADE FKs (claims, saves, reviews, devices, support) drop automatically. UI is a tucked-away destructive link at the bottom of Profile (not a big button), double-confirmed.

### Image caching (expo-image) — SHIPPED

Every **remote** photo across the app renders through `CachedImage` (`features/image/CachedImage.tsx`, wraps `expo-image` with `memory-disk` cache + 200ms fade). Replaced raw RN `<Image>` in ~15 files (deal cards, hero, vendor storefront, vouchers, reviews, checkout, profile avatar). `prefetchImages()` warms photos before they scroll into view. Local `require()` assets (e.g. the Apple Wallet badge) stay on raw `<Image>`. Native dep → needs a rebuild to activate.

### Prefetch / preload layer — SHIPPED

`usePrefetch()` warms a screen's data on `onPressIn` (fires ~80–150ms before nav, lands inside the 30s staleTime window → cache hit, no spinner): deal detail on card press, vendor on the vendor row, support thread on the active-case card. `BootWarmup` warms categories at launch; `ClaimedDealsProvider` warms active vouchers' data + images. Discipline: press-in only, never on scroll (don't spam 50 requests browsing the feed).

### Native modules in use

`@stripe/stripe-react-native`, `react-native-maps`, `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-gesture-handler`, `react-native-svg`, `react-native-passkit-wallet`, `react-native-qrcode-svg`.

Means we need a **dev-client build** (not Expo Go). Rebuild via `npx expo run:ios` whenever a native module changes or `Info.plist` changes.

### iOS gotchas baked in

- `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` in Info.plist — required for physical-device LAN connections to the dev API (added 2026-05-23).
- API URL auto-resolved at runtime from `Constants.expoConfig?.hostUri` so one bundle works for sim + device.
- Stale Metro host on iPhone (white screen, no Metro fetches) = rebuild via `npx expo run:ios --device`. Don't diagnose.

## 6A. Search & discovery engine

### 💼 The pitch

Type what you want — even misspelled ("botx") or in slang ("tox", "skinny shot") — and get the best matching deals **near you, instantly.** It understands aesthetic treatments the way patients actually talk about them, not just exact keywords. That's the difference between an app people search once, get nothing, and abandon — and one they actually use to find things. Built to feel like DoorDash/Groupon search, on infrastructure we already had.

### 🔧 Under the hood

DoorDash/Groupon-grade search, built on Postgres — **no Elasticsearch, no Algolia, no new infra**. The whole thing is one ranked query plus a domain brain. Shipped 2026-06-01.

### The one idea

**Search and filters are the same query.** There is no separate search code path — `listDeals` (`apps/api/src/domain/deals.ts`) is the single ranked engine, and search is just that engine with a text-relevance term folded into the blended score. Discover, category filter, treatment drill-down, and the search box all call the same function with different args.

### How a query becomes results

```
"botx"  ─┬─► expandQuery()  ──►  ["botx"]                    (typo: trigram saves it)
"tox"   ─┼─► expandQuery()  ──►  ["tox","botox","dysport",   (slang: synonym layer)
         │                        "jeuveau","xeomin","daxxify"]
"ozempic"┴─► expandQuery()  ──►  ["ozempic","semaglutide",   (brand→generic)
                                  "tirzepatide","weight loss"]
                                         │
                                         ▼
              SQL: pg_trgm word_similarity + substring, across
              deal title · vendor name · category · subtype
                                         │
                                         ▼
        relevance folded into the blended ranking score:
        text-match·5 + hard-match·3 + sponsored + rating − distance + recency
```

**Two layers do the magic:**

1. **Fuzzy (pg_trgm).** `word_similarity` over title/vendor/category/subtype with GIN trigram indexes (migration `20260601120000_search_trigram_indexes`). Typos resolve: "botx"→botox (0.60), "filer"→filler, "microneedeling"→microneedling. Floor at `SEARCH_SIM_THRESHOLD = 0.4` — below that, only exact/substring ("hard") matches survive, so junk → empty.
2. **Synonyms (`aestheticSynonyms.ts`).** Curated aesthetic slang/brand → treatment map a generic engine could never know: "tox"→every neuromodulator, "skinny shot"/"ozempic"→semaglutide, "fat freeze"→CoolSculpting, "vampire facial"→microneedling+PRP. Category catch-alls deliberately stripped so "tox" stays specific (neuromodulators), not all-injectables.

Ranking lives in `listDeals`' blended score: a strong text match dominates, but distance/rating/recency still tie-break — a great match nearby beats an equally-great one across town. Sponsored boost is **halved during search** so paid placement can't bury a better match.

### Endpoints (`deals.*`)

| Endpoint | What it does |
|---|---|
| `deals.list` | The feed. Now also takes `subtypeSlug` (treatment drill-down). |
| `deals.search` | `q` + all filters + `sort`. Fuzzy + synonym + ranked. |
| `deals.suggest` | Type-ahead autocomplete — treatments matching the partial query, inventory-ranked. |
| `deals.trending` | "Popular near you" — treatments with the most nearby deals (inventory-based; swap to real search/purchase counts once logged). |
| `deals.categoryTreatments` | Treatments under a category with **≥2 nearby deals** — powers the inventory-gated drill-down pills. |
| `deals.detectSubtype` | **Reverse** of the synonym engine: title → treatment, for vendor auto-tagging. |

**Filters/sort** (all on the one engine): `subtypeSlug`, `minRating`, price range, min-discount, distance, and `sort` ∈ relevance / distance / price / rating / discount.

### Treatment auto-tagging (vendor side)

The taxonomy is **8 live categories → ~128 active treatment subtypes** (Botox, Kybella, PDO threads, Dermaplaning, Fraxel, Emsculpt, TRT, Lash Extensions…) — comprehensively seeded 2026-06-09 and **admin-editable in god mode** (Admin → Treatments, see below; no more SQL migrations to add a treatment). For search to know "this deal is Botox," the deal must carry `subtype_id`. The post-deal form captures it **without overwhelming the vendor**:

- `detectTreatment(title, subtypes, categorySlug)` reads the title as they type and returns the implied treatment + confidence. **Brand names auto-fill** ("Botox — first-timer" → ✓ Botox); **generic words suggest** ("lip filler" → "Looks like Dermal Filler?"). Category-scoped so names under two categories (Laser Hair Removal) disambiguate.
- Vendor sees **one chip**, not 12. "Change" reveals only that category's treatments. Fully optional; detection never overrides a manual/edit choice.

### Customer drill-down (inventory-gated)

Pills are the **8 categories** by default. Tap one → an optional second row of **treatment** sub-pills appears — but only treatments with **≥2 nearby deals** (`TreatmentPills` renders nothing below that). Cold-start safe: with thin inventory there's no drill row (no dead-ends "showing nothing but one"); as vendors are added and treatments cross the floor, the row lights up **on its own, same code**. Drilling is always opt-in — a leading "All" pill keeps the whole category.

### Home rails & "See all" (`features/discover/`)

The Discover **All** view renders the rails fed by `deals.discoverFeed`. Presentation details:

- **4:3 rail cards** — shorter than the old portrait cards, so more of the rail is visible at a glance on small phones.
- **Inline "See all" tile** at the *end* of each rail (not a tired top-right "See all →" link — that's gone; the rail's heading stays tappable). Tapping it opens the scoped view.
- **2-up grid** — the See-all view lays deals out two-up, small-phone-friendly, with the See-all entry tile centered.

#### Recently viewed

A small horizontal strip at the **top** of the All view showing the last ~8 deals the user opened (newest first). **Device-local** — stored in `SecureStore` (`gloe.recentlyViewed.v1`), so it works logged-out, needs no backend, and is private to the device (mirrors the recent-searches pattern). Recorded on the deal-detail screen once a deal successfully loads; the rail fetches card data via `deals.byIds` (which drops any deal no longer active, so the strip self-heals). Renders nothing until there's at least one. Code: `useRecentlyViewed.ts`, `RecentlyViewed.tsx`, `deals.byIds`.

#### Editorial sections (GLO-27) — admin-authored taglines that pool categories AND/OR treatments

The rail headings are **not** the dry category noun. They're **admin-authored editorial sections**: each is a warm tagline that *replaces* the category label, an optional **typed description** rendered under it, and a target set pooling **whole categories and/or specific treatments**. e.g. "Find fillers & Botox to boost your glow" (→ Injectables), "Look snatched" (→ Injectables + Skin), or "Rhinoplasty, without living with it forever" (→ just the Liquid Rhinoplasty treatment + a description). The founder authors / reorders / toggles them in **Admin → Discover** (DB is the source of truth — no code release to change copy; mirrors `platform_fees` / trending config).

- **Data:** `discover_sections` (tagline, **description**, image_url, display_order, active) + `discover_section_categories` join → `service_categories` + `discover_section_subtypes` join → `service_subtypes`. The taxonomy tables are untouched; sections *reference* them.
- **Backend:** `getDiscoverFeed` loads active sections and pools each section's targets via `listDeals({ categories: [...], subtypes: [...] })` — one query, OR-combined (`c.slug = ANY(cats) OR s.slug = ANY(subs)`), deduped. **No active sections → graceful fallback to one rail per category** (the feed is never blank). A section whose every target is deactivated pools nothing and is skipped.
- **"Browse by category" tiles stay per-category** — they're a nav shortcut *into* a raw category, so they're computed separately (`feed.browse`, one lightweight aggregate: count + a photo per category) and don't become editorial.
- **"See all":** a pure single-category section opens the normal category view; a multi-category **or treatment-targeted** section opens a **pooled, tagline-titled** scope (`deals.list({ categories, subtypes })`) with the description under the heading. *(Web parity note: the web home renders the editorial rails incl. description, but a multi-category/treatment section's "View more" is omitted on web — the SEO `/treatments/[slug]` page is single-category; full pooled web listing is a fast-follow. Mobile fully delivers the pooled See-all.)*
- **Code:** `discoverSections.ts` (domain), `admin.router.ts` (CRUD), `deals.ts` (`getDiscoverFeed` + pooled `listDeals`), mobile `discover.tsx` / `CategoryRail.tsx` / `BrowseByCategory.tsx`, web `(consumer)/page.tsx`, admin `SectionsView.tsx` (tagline + description + category chips + searchable treatment picker).

### Search screen (`apps/mobile/app/(app)/search.tsx`)

Debounced (180ms) instant results · autocomplete suggestion chips while typing · idle state = recent searches (SecureStore) + "popular near you" · **zero results never dead-ends** (suggests popular nearby treatments) · compact result rows (resized thumbs, price/discount, vendor·rating·distance) with save + prefetch tap-through.

### Map discovery (`apps/mobile/app/(app)/map.tsx`, GLO-25)

ResortPass-style full-screen map, reached via the **square brand-colored map button** to the right of the discover search bar (`features/discover-header/MapButton.tsx`; the search bar itself is now square-cornered to match). iOS-first — Android is a deliberate fast-follow.

- Opens centered on the user's current browse location ("Near you") from `SelectedLocationProvider`.
- **Static top chrome** (3 rows): location bar · **category tabs** (`CategoryTabs` — text + underline, scrollable, the "what am I browsing" switch; same DB taxonomy via `useCategoryOptions`) · **filter pill row** `MapFilterChips` (Filter · Vibe · Price · Rating · Sort — "refine it"). The tab-vs-pill split (ResortPass pattern) is map-only; the Discover home keeps its own pill + browse-tile layout. Every chip opens `MapFilterSheet` focused on its section; all map 1:1 onto `deals.list` inputs (`mapFilters.ts`), so applying is a spread. Vibe/rating/sort/price are **fully wired**, not stubs.
- **One teal pin per spa** (`groupDealsBySpa` collapses the deal list to vendors; GLO-25 decision = card-per-spa, not per-deal). Pins **cluster** when zoomed out via a dependency-free grid bucketer (`clustering.ts`) — no supercluster lib. The active spa's pin darkens to ink.
- **Three-detent bottom sheet** (`MapBrowseSheet`, RN core Animated + PanResponder, no sheet/gesture dep): **collapsed** = map + swipeable cards; **mid** = cards crossfade out, sheet rises to ~45% with the vertical listing and a map peek above; **full** = map gone, straight scrollable listing under the pinned header. One `Animated.Value` (the sheet's top) drives the snap + the card↔list opacity crossfade.
- **Swipeable cards** (`MapDealCard.tsx`) two-way synced to the pins: swiping a card centers + highlights its pin; tapping a pin collapses the sheet and scrolls its card into view. A card shows the spa's headline deal + vibe + "+N more experiences" (routes to the vendor storefront when the spa has several).
- **"Search this area"** pill appears after panning and re-queries `deals.list` using the visible map center + a radius derived from the region span — **no backend change** (vendor lat/lng already ride on every deal).

**Vibes** (the spa's "feel" — a real aesthetics-purchase driver): a `vibes` jsonb array on `vendors` (mirrors `amenities` — `apps/api/src/domain/vibes.ts` canonical list, GIN-indexed, migration `20260606200000_add_vendor_vibes`). Vendors self-select 1–3 in the Post-Deal form (`VibePicker`); shown on the consumer storefront; filtered on the map via `deals.list`'s `vibes` input (`v.vibes ?| array[...]`). `deals.list` also gained `minRating` + `sort` inputs (already supported by `listDeals`, just newly exposed) to power the Rating + Sort chips. Seeded vibes backfilled for the demo spas.

### Why it scales (and won't hurt us later)

Everything is **data-driven + adaptive + human-confirmed**, nothing cemented to "4 deals in San Diego":
- Taxonomy = DB rows. Add "Kybella" = one INSERT → it shows in search, pills, and the detector instantly.
- Drill-downs gate on **live counts** — embarrassing-at-4-deals (hides depth), great-at-4,000 (reveals it), zero code change.
- Synonym/alias maps are additive and degrade gracefully (a missing alias just falls back to fuzzy).
- Relevance is abstracted in the ranking → swapping pg_trgm for **Algolia / pgvector semantic / ML learning-to-rank** later is a layer swap, not a rewrite.

**The one future-proofing TODO:** search/click logging (the data flywheel). Cheap now, it's what powers real "trending," learned synonyms, and ML ranking once there's traffic. Not yet wired — the deliberate "invest now, win later" piece.

## 6B. Claim, pay & "Share to pay"

### 💼 The pitch

A customer finds a deal and buys a voucher in **seconds** — Apple Pay or card, right in the app, no account-funding or wallet top-up. If she'd rather **someone else pay** (her mom, her partner), she taps **"Share to pay,"** texts a link, and whoever opens it pays — but the voucher still lands in **her** account. We never hold inventory or take payment risk; Stripe runs the charge and we orchestrate. **We make money on a platform fee taken out of each sale** (see §2). The voucher only exists once money clears, so there's no "paid but no voucher" or "voucher but no money" state.

### 🔧 Under the hood

`apps/api/src/domain/checkout.ts` + `checkout.router.ts`. Two entry points, one fulfillment path:

- **In-app purchase** — `checkout.createPurchase`. Computes the fee on the order total (`computeFee`), creates a **held Stripe PaymentIntent**, writes a `pending_payment` row in `transactions`, returns the `clientSecret` → the app's Stripe **PaymentSheet** (Apple Pay + card). Vouchers (`claims`) are minted **only** on the `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook — one per quantity — so an unpaid order never yields a live voucher.
- **Share to pay** — `checkout.createGiftLink`. Creates a Stripe **Checkout Session** (Stripe-hosted page) and returns a Gloē URL (`PUBLIC_WEB_ORIGIN`). Any cardholder pays on that page; the voucher credits to the **redeemer** (`metadata.userId`), not the payer. Hard **$500/link cap** (`GIFT_LINK_MAX_AMOUNT_CENTS`) bounds fraud blast-radius since cardholder ≠ redeemer. Tagged `payment_source='gift_link'`.
- Both converge on `fulfillPurchase` (resolved from the webhook by PaymentIntent id or Checkout Session id), which mints the vouchers. The full money flow — fee tiers, held funds, transfer on redemption — is **§4**.

---

## 6C. Apple Wallet passes

### 💼 The pitch

After buying, the customer adds her voucher to **Apple Wallet** with one tap — so it lives on her lock screen and she can redeem at the counter **without even opening the app**. It feels premium and legitimate (like an airline boarding pass), and it keeps Gloē present on her phone between visits. A small thing that makes the whole product feel real.

### 🔧 Under the hood

`apps/api/src/domain/walletPass.ts` (`buildVoucherPass`) builds a **signed `.pkpass`** with `passkit-generator`: Apple **`coupon`** layout, `serialNumber = claim.id`, a QR barcode carrying the redemption payload. Signed with the Pass Type ID cert (`signerCert.pem` + `signerKey.pem` + WWDR), loaded from `secrets/` locally or base64 env vars in prod (see §11 Phase 4). Mobile: `features/wallet/AddToWalletBadge.tsx` renders the official Add-to-Apple-Wallet button and hands the pass to PassKit.

**Live updates** (flipping the pass to "Redeemed" automatically) need the APNs **Pass Web Service** — the `pass_registrations` schema exists, the wiring is pending. Not a launch blocker. See §10.

---

## 6D. Push notifications

### 💼 The pitch

Gloē pings the customer **when it matters** — a reply from support, a voucher about to expire, a redemption confirmation. That's what brings people back and builds trust that the app is "alive." We ask for permission **contextually** (after her first save or purchase, not on a cold launch) — the difference between ~60–80% opt-in and ~20%.

### 🔧 Under the hood

**Direct APNs** (no Expo push middleman): ES256 JWT auth with the `.p8` key (`apps/api/src/domain/apns.ts`). Device tokens are registered by `features/notifications/PushRegistrationBridge.tsx` + `usePushRegistration.ts` → stored in the `devices` table (`devices.ts` / `devices.router.ts`). A `410 Gone` from APNs prunes the dead token. Capability + entitlement notes are in §11.

**Notification registry** (`apps/api/src/domain/notifications.ts`): every push type is a row in `notification_types` (key, `enabled`, `delay_minutes`, `{{var}}` copy templates). No code sends a push directly — call-sites call `sendNotification(key, userId, …)`, which checks the registry: disabled → no-op; `delay_minutes = 0` → send now; `> 0` → enqueue into `notification_queue`. An in-API cron (60s tick in `index.ts`) drains due rows, re-checking per-type guards (e.g. *skip the review prompt if she already reviewed*) before sending. Idempotent via a partial index on unsent rows + a `dedup_key`. Seeded types: **gift_booked** + **support_reply** (immediate), **review_prompt** (default 3h after redemption, off by default). Admins manage all of it — toggle, delay, copy — in the **Notifications** panel under god-mode → Settings (`admin.listNotificationTypes` / `updateNotificationType`). Adding a push type = one INSERT + one `sendNotification` call; it appears in the panel automatically.

---

## 6E. App shell & bottom navigation

### 💼 The pitch

**Four tabs, the whole app:** **Discover** (find deals), **Saved** (your shortlist), **Wallet** (your vouchers + the QR to redeem), **Profile** (account, support, settings). Simple enough that a first-timer understands the entire product in five seconds — which is the point. iPhone-only for v1 (iPad is a roadmap item).

### 🔧 Under the hood

`apps/mobile/app/(app)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` — Expo Router `Tabs`, four screens (`discover`, `saved`, `wallet`, `profile`), icons via `features/tabs/TabIcon.tsx`, brand-tinted active state. The **Wallet tab** (`wallet.tsx`) is the voucher home: active vouchers sorted soonest-to-expire, a hero treatment for the most-urgent one, tap → `/my-deal/[id]` for the full-screen QR. (This tab replaced the old "messages" tab — see git history.)

---

## 7. Vendor portal

### 💼 The pitch

Where a medspa runs its Gloē presence: sign up, get approved, **post deals** (auto-tagged by treatment), **scan customers' QR codes** to redeem, and **get paid**. Free to join, no monthly fee — the whole reason vendors say yes instead of burning $1k/mo on Instagram ads. Built as a website (not an app) because owners and front-desk staff live on a laptop at the counter.

### 🔧 Under the hood

`apps/web/src/app/vendor` (Next.js).

### Screens shipped

| Screen | What it does |
|---|---|
| Signup | Business name, phone, address (Places autocomplete), categories. Creates vendor + Stripe Express account. |
| **Claim flow (GLO-5)** | For admin-pre-created (unclaimed) vendors. `/vendor` silently runs `vendor.claimByEmail` before ever showing the signup form: if an unclaimed vendor's `email` matches one of the signed-in user's **verified** Clerk emails, `owner_user_id` links atomically and they land in their own dashboard (no duplicate vendor). Signup screen keeps a quiet "Check again" retry under the form (covers the email-added-after-first-visit case). Audited (`vendor.claimed`). Code: `domain/vendorClaim.ts`. |
| **License verification (GLO-19)** | Settings → "Medical license & verification" card. Vendor submits license number + state + type + a photo/PDF of the license (private `license-docs` bucket). Lands `pending_review`; admin approves (→ verified, and a `pending_approval` vendor flips `active`) or rejects with a reason the vendor sees verbatim and can resubmit against. The checklist's license step only turns green on admin approval — this is what backs "vetted & licensed." Code: `domain/vendorLicense.ts`, `LicenseCard.tsx`. |
| Dashboard | Hub snapshot: sold today, redeemed today, active vouchers, held balance, 7d paid, in-transit, failed payout count. |
| Stripe balance widget | Real-time Stripe `available` + `pending` balances. Separate query from hub snapshot. |
| Post Deal | Full form — title, description, variants, photos, video upload, amenities, **vibe (1–3)**, 1–2 categories, restrictions, fine print. Draft or submit for review. |
| Scan tab | Live QR camera (html5-qrcode) + manual code input fallback. Lookup → confirm → redeem. Blocked until Stripe onboarding done. |
| Stripe Connect onboarding | Generates hosted Express onboarding link. Status mirrored back via webhook. |
| Instant payout | "Pay me now" button. Eligibility: payouts_enabled + debit card. ~30 min arrival, 3% fee. |

### Vendor edit flow

`updateDeal` mutation exists. Edit UI shipped but not feature-flagged separately.

---

## 8. Admin (god mode)

### 💼 The pitch

The founder's cockpit — **one screen to run the entire business:** approve vendors, watch the money, set fees, issue refunds, handle support, and audit every action. It's what lets one person operate a two-sided marketplace without a team. If the consumer app is the storefront and the vendor portal is the back office, this is mission control.

### 🔧 Under the hood

`apps/web/src/app/admin` (Next.js).

### Tabs

| Tab | What it does |
|---|---|
| Vendors | Sortable table. Columns: name, city, Stripe status, **license status (—/Review/Verified/Rejected)**, tier, actions. Filter by status/tier/suspended + **"License review" chip** (the GLO-19 review queue). |
| Vendor detail | Full profile, Stripe account status, deal roster, audit trail. **License & verification card (GLO-19):** submitted number/state/type, signed link to the doc (private bucket, ~10 min URL), Approve / Reject-with-reason; approving a `pending_approval` vendor takes them live. Header tag shows license state. **Invite owner (GLO-5):** on an unclaimed vendor, "✉ Invite owner" fires a Clerk invitation to the owner email (prompts for one if missing; Add-spa captures it at create), stamps `owner_invited_at`, shows invited-date + resend. The invite link lands on `/sign-up?redirect_url=/vendor&invited_email=…` — a create-password page that names the invited email (the Clerk ticket pre-verifies it, no code to type) and hides the SSO buttons so the account can't be created under a different address, which would break the claim-by-email match. If the email already has an account, the button explains they can just sign in at `/vendor` (claim runs automatically). Suspend / unsuspend. Suspend pulls every live/paused/pending deal to draft, stamping `deals.pre_suspend_status`; reinstate restores each deal to exactly its prior status (manually-republished deals untouched, markers cleared). |
| Deals | Pending review queue. Approve / reject / comment. |
| Money / Payouts | Payout list (filter pending/in-transit/paid/failed). Release transfer button. Retry failed payout. Reconcile. |
| **Refunds** | Dedicated refund ledger over the audit log: who issued it, when, amount of total, which order, **was the voucher already redeemed (⚠ flag)**, full/partial/blocked attempt, reason, Stripe refund id. Summary strip + outcome filter (All / Refunded / Blocked). |
| Fees | Global tier config (create, update, deactivate). Per-vendor override per row. |
| Audit | Every mutation. Filter by action / vendor / user / date. |
| Transactions | Browse + drill into individual transactions. |
| Customers | Roster → **full-page Customer 360** (`/admin/customer/[id]`, GLO-56 — no drawer): every purchase with its cash/credit/promo split, all vouchers, refund history, embedded credit ledger (grant/revoke), referral picture, ledger freeze/unfreeze, **one-off push** (`admin.sendCustomerPush` → registry type `admin_message`, audited as `customer.push_sent`), duplicate-charge alerts, per-txn full/partial refunds, last-seen-near city (from browse location). |
| **Support** | Concierge tickets. Widened drawer with: chat (photo/video), **boss-view customer profile** (lifetime spend, refund %, auto-flags), **order-context history** (which order the ticket is about + all past orders), **inline refund/partial-refund per order**, and refund-badge cross-link → Refunds tab. Reply + push-on-reply, resolve/close. |

**Cross-tab links:** the "refunded $X ↗" badge anywhere (support drawer, customer drawer) jumps to the Refunds tab and flashes the matching record (targeted by transactionId). Customer names in the Refunds ledger jump to that customer's drawer.

---

## 9. Credits, promos & referrals (the incentives platform)

### 💼 The pitch

One incentives engine, two levers. **Wallet credits** (GLO-24) are personal dollars that follow the customer — earned from referrals, campaigns, refund returns, or (dormant) purchase tiers, auto-applied at checkout. **Deal promos** (GLO-44, §4) are public "Extra $X off" discounts sitting on a deal. Governing rule: **incentives are platform-funded** — vendor payout math never changes — unless the vendor explicitly funds their own boost. Checkout order: promo cuts the price → credits cover the remainder → card pays the rest.

**Status: BUILT** (branch `ryan/glo-24…`/`glo-44`, 2026-06). Launch posture: referral $20/$20 **ON** ($50 first-booking floor), purchase tiers + signup bonus seeded **OFF**, campaigns on demand, promos per deal.

### 🔧 Under the hood — the ledger

**Lot-based, append-only** (`supabase/migrations/20260610120000_credits_platform.sql`):

- `credit_lots` — every grant. `amount_cents`, `remaining_cents` (the ONLY mutable column; clawback may push it negative), `expires_at`, kind ∈ `referral_give | referral_get | purchase_reward | signup_bonus | promo | admin_grant | refund_return`.
- `credit_entries` — append-only debits pointing at their lot: `redemption | expiry | clawback | forfeiture`.
- Balance = `SUM(remaining_cents)` across lots; UI floors at $0. Redemption consumes lots FIFO-by-soonest-expiry.
- `credit_rules` — god-mode-editable program knobs (the `platform_fees` pattern): tier brackets, referral give/get + `min_first_purchase_cents`, `expires_after_days` (default 90), monthly caps.
- `credit_campaigns` — push-credit blasts; audience ∈ `everyone | lapsed_60d | signed_up_never_purchased`, optionally **drilled down by city** (`audience_city` matches `users.last_city`); idempotent per (campaign, user).
- `users.last_lat/last_lng/last_city/last_location_at` — **last-known approximate location**, captured opportunistically from signed-in browse calls (the app already sends coords to `deals.list`/`discoverFeed`/`search` for distance ranking). Foreground-only by construction, rounded to 3 decimals (~city block), throttled to one write / 15 min, city re-geocoded only on a ≥10 km move (`domain/userLocation.ts`). Powers the Customers "Last seen near" column, the Customer 360 header line, and campaign city targeting (`admin.listCustomerCities` feeds the picker). Disclosed in the privacy policy; nutrition label must say Location = collected, linked.

**One door:** `grantCredit()` (`credits.ts`) is the only code path that mints lots. Idempotency walls (partial unique indexes): (kind, transaction_id), (kind, referral_id), (campaign_id, user_id) — webhook retries and double-clicks return `duplicate`, never double money.

### Checkout integration (`checkout.ts`)

`computeApplicableCredits()` runs **inside** the purchase transaction with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the user's lots + a pending-order reservation window — concurrent checkouts cannot spend the same balance. Client sends only the on/off toggle; amounts are server-computed. Stripe 50¢ floor: a 1–49¢ cash sliver shaves applied credit to leave exactly 50¢. 100% coverage → **zero-dollar path**: no PaymentIntent, inline `fulfillPurchase` (vouchers + receipt + drawdown in one txn). `transactions.credits_applied_cents` records the split; `consumer_paid_cents` stays the full order value so fee + vendor payout never change. Platform margin on a credited txn = `platform_fee_cents − credits_applied_cents`.

### Referrals (`referrals.ts`)

Personal 6-char code (no-vowel alphabet, e.g. `RYAN20`) + share link; attribution stored on the user row at signup. Referee's `referral_give` lot lands at attribution but is **locked until a first purchase ≥ the rule floor** (spendable at that checkout). `maybePayoutReferrerOnFirstPurchase()` fires post-fulfillment: verifies first-ness, the floor (on the **post-promo** total), then grants `referral_get`. Fraud walls: self-referral block, **card-fingerprint match voids the referrer payout**, deleted-account **salted email-hash denylist** (re-signup ≠ new user), monthly caps on referral+signup sources only.

### Lifecycle

- **Refunds** are split-tender (`vendorOps.ts`): cash → card, credit share → `refund_return` lot with expiry = max(original remaining window, 30d). Earned credits (tier reward, both referral sides) **claw back** via `unwindCreditsForTransaction` when the refund breaks the qualifying floor. DB CHECKs cap `refunded_cents` at the true cash share (credits and platform-funded promo discounts excluded).
- **Disputes** freeze the ledger (`users.credit_frozen_at`); frozen wallets can't redeem; dispute-won unfreezes (GLO-34 webhook).
- **Expiry**: daily in-process sweep (`index.ts`) — `expireOverdueLots()` zeroes overdue remainders, `sendCreditExpiryNudges()` queues 7d/1d push+email via the notification registry (`credit_expiry_reminder`, dedup'd per lot+window).
- **Account deletion** forfeits the balance (`forfeiture` entries) and records the email hash; delete-confirmation warns "you'll forfeit $X."

### God mode

**Credits tab** (`CreditsView.tsx` / `creditAdmin.ts`): rules editor, campaigns (compose → preview audience+cost → send), per-customer ledger with manual grant/revoke (reason required, audited), program dashboard — issued / redeemed / clawed back / expired / forfeited / **outstanding liability** — plus platform Stripe balance vs exposure. **Promos tab** (`PromosView.tsx`): see §4 Deal promos. Audit actions: `credit.*`, `credit_rule.*`, `credit_campaign.*`, `referral.*`, `deal_promo.*`.

**Error UX (delivery hardening, 2026-06-12):** every god-mode form validates inline with a plain-English message *before* the round-trip ("Add a note — the customer sees it in their email"), and a global tRPC `errorFormatter` (`trpc.ts → friendlyZodMessage`) turns any zod rejection into one human sentence instead of the raw JSON issue dump — this applies to every router, not just credits. Cross-surface sweep (same day): vendor portal + consumer web already rendered `error.message` inline, so they inherit the formatter for free; the silent-failure gaps were closed — mobile support create/reply now show the real error (reply restores the draft on failure), the claim sheet stays open with the message instead of closing silently, waitlist join shows the real reason, consumer account-deletion and the instant-payout/save-spa toggles surface failures. Sending a campaign to an audience of 0 refuses without burning the draft; deactivating a missing rule says "Rule not found." Regression harness: `apps/api/scripts/glo24-godmode-e2e.ts` (50 assertions — wire messages, rule shapes/conflict walls, grant/revoke ledger math, freeze/thaw, campaign draft lifecycle; throwaway fixtures, full cleanup, never sends a real campaign).

### Why it scales

Every knob is a DB row (no-deploy program changes); balance is a SUM over an append-only ledger (no drifting counters, full replayability); no per-user jobs (one daily sweep + the 60s notification queue); economics are observable before they bite (per-txn credit cost line, liability dashboard, promo cost-to-date). The credit share of payouts is funded from the platform Stripe balance — the balance-vs-liability indicator is the number to watch as the program grows.

### ⚖️ Legal hooks

ToS: no cash value, non-transferable, no gifts with credits, per-rule expiry, reversal on refund/dispute, forfeiture on deletion, program modifiable. Privacy: referral attribution + salted email-hash retention post-deletion. (Both flagged on GLO-15 for the counsel pass.)

## 10. What's shipped, what's pending

**Audited against code on 2026-06-01.** Use this as the live status board — update as features land. See the 🚨 must-have table below for the launch-blocker shortlist.

### Shipped (works end-to-end)

- Consumer app: Discover, Saved, Wallet, Profile, Deal detail, Voucher (QR). (Search screen is a **stub** — see gaps below.)
- Sign in / sign up via Clerk (incl. 2FA).
- Real GPS + location permission (contextual).
- Vendor signup, dashboard, post deal, scan + redeem, instant payout.
- Stripe Connect Express onboarding (vendor-side hosted flow).
- Money pipeline: PaymentIntent → Transfer on redemption (11 walls) → payout webhook mirror.
- Refunds (pre-redemption + post-redemption with transfer reversal).
- Apple Wallet pass generation (signed .pkpass).
- APNs push notification stack (ES256 JWT, device token registration, 410 cleanup).
- Admin: vendors, deals, payouts, fees (incl. per-vendor), audit, transactions, customers.
- **Refunds tab** (god mode) — dedicated forensic ledger over the audit log: actor, amount, order, redeemed-before-refund flag, full/partial/blocked, reason, Stripe id. Cross-linked from support + customer drawers. §8.
- **Search & discovery engine** — fuzzy (pg_trgm) + aesthetic synonym/slang-aware search, location-ranked, with autocomplete, recent/trending, smart no-dead-end empty state; vendor treatment auto-tagging (title→subtype detector); inventory-gated treatment drill-down pills; sort + treatment/rating filters. Full breakdown in **§6A**.
- **Support boss-view + order context + inline refunds** — support drawer shows a full customer profile (lifetime spend, refund %, auto-flags), the customer's order history (incl. which order the ticket is about), and refund/partial-refund actions per order without leaving the chat. §8.
- **Concierge support tickets** (consumer↔Gloē) — chat, photo/video attachments (camera + library), god-mode reply + push-on-reply. §6.
- **Account deletion** in-app (Apple 5.1.1(v)) — anonymize-and-deactivate. §6.
- **Out-of-area waitlist gate** — ComingSoon screen + demand capture + admin Waitlist tab. §6.
- **Image caching** (expo-image) across all remote photos + a press-in prefetch/preload layer. §6.
- **Vendor-only redemption** — consumer self-redeem removed (was a payout footgun). §6.
- Reconciliation query (manual trigger).
- Railway deploy (api + web). `.env.example` for contributors.
- Web SEO: favicon, OG card, PWA manifest, robots, sitemap.
- iOS app icon (gold G on dark brand) wired into Expo + Xcode. iPhone-only for v1 (iPad device-family off; iPad is a v2 roadmap item).

### 🚨 Launch must-haves NOT yet done (the real blocker list)

Ranked. These are what stand between "today" and "your wife's friend can install and buy." Everything else in this section is post-launch polish — see §14. **Audited against code 2026-06-01.**

| # | Blocker | Why it blocks launch | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Sign in with Apple** | Hard App Store **rejection** (Guideline 4.8). We offer Google/Facebook/TikTok social login but NOT Apple — Apple requires an equivalent Apple option whenever third-party social login exists. `SocialAuthButtons.tsx` has no `apple` provider. | ~2h (Clerk supports it; add provider + button + entitlement) | ❌ Not built |
| 2 | **Dispute / chargeback webhook** | Money-loss + integrity. ✅ **Shipped (GLO-34):** `charge.dispute.*` freezes unredeemed vouchers, halts the payout (wall #12), flags already-redeemed orders, and reconciles a lost dispute. **Remaining config:** enable `charge.dispute.created/.updated/.closed` on the live Stripe webhook endpoint. | done | ✅ Built (enable events in Stripe) |
| 3 | **Transactional receipts (Resend)** | Receipts are the #1 chargeback-preventer. ✅ **Shipped (GLO-37):** Resend wired, `mail.gloe.app` verified, branded receipt fires on `fulfillPurchase`. **Launch step:** flip Resend out of testing mode → production. | done | ✅ Built (toggle Resend to prod at launch) |
| 4 | **Apple Pay finish** | Code-complete (`merchantIdentifier` set), but needs Stripe Apple Pay cert + live-domain registration + a native device rebuild to actually charge. | ~1h once certs in hand | 🟡 Code-done, config pending |
| 5 | **ATT prompt** | ✅ **Resolved — not needed (GLO-13, code-verified 2026-06-11).** The app ships with zero ads/attribution SDKs, no IDFA access, no analytics. Apple's rule: apps that don't track must **not** show the ATT prompt. So: no `expo-tracking-transparency`, no `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription`, App Privacy answer = "Data **not** used to track you." **Revisit trigger:** adding any ads/attribution SDK (Meta/TikTok/Google Ads, AppsFlyer/Adjust/Branch) or anything reading the IDFA. First-party crash/product analytics (Sentry, Mixpanel used first-party only) do **not** trigger ATT by themselves — only cross-company linking/sharing does. | — | ✅ Not needed at launch |
| 6 | **Universal Links / AASA** | Gift + deal share links (`/deal/*`, `/gift/*`) won't deep-link into the app without the `.well-known/apple-app-site-association` file served by web + `associatedDomains` in `app.json`. Not strictly a rejection, but share/gift flows are broken without it. | ~1h + rebuild | ❌ Not served |
| 7 | **ToS + Privacy Policy (hosted)** | App Store **requires** a Privacy Policy URL; "marketplace facilitator, not provider" clauses are legal protection for an aesthetic-services marketplace. ✅ **Counsel-depth drafts hosted (final pass 2026-06-12):** full consumer ToS at `/legal/terms` (now incl. arbitration + class-action waiver, indemnification, CA-gift-card-safe expiry language — paid value survives expiry, only promotional value lapses), CCPA-aware privacy at `/legal/privacy`, and the **Vendor Agreement** v2026-06-12 (GLO-35 — facilitator + chargeback-liability + fee/offset + indemnification clauses) at `/legal/vendor-terms`, accepted via a required checkbox at vendor signup (stamped `terms_accepted_at`/`terms_version`). Deal form shows live "You earn" fee preview (`vendor.feePreview`) to match the agreement's disclosure promise. Consumer-side acceptance = Clerk legal-consent toggle (see §11 Clerk block). **Remaining:** counsel review (GLO-15). | counsel pass | 🟡 Drafts live, counsel pending |
| 8 | **Support email** | App Store needs a Support URL; `hello@gloe.app` forwarding must work. (The old "landing page" half of this item is obsolete — GLO-16 canceled; `gloe.app` is now the full consumer marketplace and serves as the ad/App Store destination.) | ~1h | 🟡 Verify forwarding |

**Not blockers (explicitly OK to launch without):** robust search, deeper filters, credit/loyalty, Wallet live updates, OTA, map tab, OSRM, reconciliation cron. All parked in §14.

The **infra switches** (Stripe live keys, live webhook, Railway env, EAS build, TestFlight, submission) are mechanical and fully scripted in §11 — they're "do the runbook," not "figure out what to build." The table above is the *build* work that must precede the runbook.

### Pending / stubs / known gaps

- ~~**Robust search (DoorDash-style)**~~ — **DONE** (2026-06-01). Fuzzy + synonym-aware search, location-ranked, autocomplete, recent/trending, smart empty state, treatment auto-tagging, inventory-gated drill-down. Full system in **§6A**. Remaining tail:
  - **Search/click logging** — not wired. The data flywheel for real "trending" + learned synonyms + ML ranking later. Cheap to add; the deliberate "invest now, win later" piece.
  - **`FilterSheet` sort/rating UI** — the engine accepts `sort` (relevance/distance/price/rating/discount) + `minRating`, but the mobile FilterSheet doesn't expose controls for them yet (search screen + treatment pills do the heavy lifting). Add the controls to surface them.
  - **"Open now" filter** — deferred: `hours_summary` is freetext, not structured. Needs structured hours before it can be a filter that doesn't lie.
- **Apple Pay** — code-complete in Stripe PaymentSheet; needs Merchant ID + Stripe cert + native device rebuild. Tonight session.
- **Apple Wallet live updates** — pass generation ships, but status flips (e.g. "Redeemed") need APNs Pass Web Service spec wiring. Schema for `pass_registrations` is there. Not a launch blocker.
- ~~**Delete account in-app**~~ — **DONE** (`me.deleteAccount`, anonymize-and-deactivate; see §6).
- **ATT prompt** — ✅ resolved (GLO-13): not needed; the app does zero cross-app tracking. Revisit only if an ads/attribution SDK or IDFA use ever ships (see §10 table row 5 for the exact trigger).
- ~~**Map discovery**~~ — **DONE** (GLO-25; ResortPass-style, reached via the search-bar map button, not a bottom tab — see §6A "Map discovery").
- ~~**Credit & loyalty system**~~ — **DONE** (GLO-24: lot-based wallet ledger, referrals $20/$20, campaigns, god-mode Credits tab; purchase tiers + signup bonus built but OFF). Deal promos too (GLO-44). See §9.
- **Sentry + Mixpanel** — not wired.
- **CI/CD** — no `.github/workflows/`. Manual Railway deploy.
- **OTA updates (expo-updates)** — not installed; no `eas.json`. Every mobile update is a full rebuild today. Wire OTA when cutting the first TestFlight build (see §11 Phase 5). Deferred on purpose while native code churns.
- **Supabase migrations in repo** — not visible. Schema managed directly. Risky — add migration tracking before next major schema change.
- ~~**Coupon / manual credit issuance in admin**~~ — **DONE** (god-mode manual grant/revoke on any customer ledger + credit campaigns; GLO-24).
- **OSRM self-hosted routing** — current drive-time is straight-line × tiered mph (±20%, $0). Deferred until margin demands it.
- **Reconciliation cron** — query exists, schedule not wired.
- **Dispute / chargeback webhook** — ✅ shipped (GLO-34): `charge.dispute.*` freezes the voucher, halts the payout (wall #12), and reconciles a lost dispute. See §4 "Disputes & chargebacks." The only remaining step is **enabling the three `charge.dispute.*` events on the live Stripe webhook endpoint**.
- **Nightly DB backups** — Supabase free tier has daily; verify and document recovery.

## 11. Pre-launch runbook

When you say "ready to ship," walk this top to bottom. Every box matters.

### Phase 1 — Apple App Store hygiene (rejection blockers)

1. **Delete account** — add row in profile settings → Clerk `user.delete()` + tRPC mutation. Confirmation dialog. (Apple 5.1.1(v).)
2. **Sign in with Apple** — ⚠️ NOT BUILT. `SocialAuthButtons.tsx` offers Google/Facebook/TikTok but no Apple provider → guaranteed rejection (Apple 4.8). Enable `oauth_apple` in Clerk, add the Apple button at equal prominence, add the `com.apple.developer.applesignin` entitlement, rebuild. **Blocker #1 — do this first.**
3. **ATT** — ✅ resolved (GLO-13): the app does **no** cross-app tracking → show **no** ATT prompt, add **no** `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription`, and answer App Privacy "Data **not** used to track you." Becomes mandatory the day an ads/attribution SDK or IDFA use lands. (Apple 5.1.2.)
4. **Location asked in context** — move from cold launch to "Near me" filter tap. (Apple 5.1.1.)
5. **OG meta tags on `gloe.app/deal/[id]`** — title, og:title, og:description, og:image (deal hero), twitter:card. Validate at opengraph.xyz.
6. **App Review demo account** — `apple-review@gloe.app` with claimed deals + one redeemed voucher + test card. Provide in App Store Connect → App Review Info.
7. **Privacy nutrition label** — declare Clerk, Stripe, Google Maps, own DB. Undeclared = rejection.

### Phase 2 — Apple Developer Portal

8. **Pass Type ID cert** — exists. Production uses same cert.
9. **APNs Auth Key** — `.p8` in `apps/api/secrets/AuthKey_<KEYID>.p8`. Note Key ID + Team ID `MW2DS9PQD6`.
10. **Universal Links** — app id `com.gloe.app` → Associated Domains capability. In `app.json` ios.associatedDomains: `["applinks:gloe.app"]`. Serve `https://gloe.app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` as plain JSON:
    ```json
    {"applinks":{"apps":[],"details":[{"appID":"MW2DS9PQD6.com.gloe.app","paths":["/deal/*","/gift/*","/vendor/*"]}]}}
    ```
    Validate at branch.io/resources/aasa-validator/. Requires native rebuild.
11. **Apple Pay Merchant ID** — `merchant.com.gloe.app` already linked. No production change.
12. **Push Notifications capability** — currently NOT enabled on the App ID. Causes `aps-environment` entitlement build errors. Enable in dev portal → Identifiers → com.gloe.app → check Push Notifications → Save.

### Phase 3 — Stripe production switches

13. Flip Stripe Dashboard to live mode (top-right toggle).
14. **Live API keys** — `sk_live_*` + `pk_live_*` → Railway env `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`. Update `EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in EAS build profile.
15. **Live webhook** — new endpoint in live mode → `https://<railway-domain>/webhooks/stripe`. Events: `account.updated`, `payout.created`, `payout.paid`, `payout.failed`, `payout.canceled`, `checkout.session.completed`, `payment_intent.succeeded`. Copy signing secret → Railway env `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
16. **Stripe Connect — production onboarding** — dev `acct_*` are sandbox. Real vendors re-onboard via live Express URL.
17. **Apple Pay live domain** — Stripe Dashboard → Settings → Payment methods → Apple Pay → register `gloe.app`.

### Phase 4 — Railway env vars (full template)

```
# Required
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=4000
DATABASE_URL=<Supabase prod connection string>

# Clerk (LIVE)
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...

# Stripe (LIVE)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Google Maps
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=...

# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=https://<project>.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...

# Public origin (used in gift URLs, OG-tag canonical)
PUBLIC_WEB_ORIGIN=https://gloe.app

# Apple Wallet — base64'd because Railway env is text-only
APPLE_TEAM_ID=MW2DS9PQD6
APPLE_PASS_TYPE_ID=pass.com.gloe.voucher
APPLE_PASS_SIGNER_KEY_PASSPHRASE=<passphrase>
APPLE_PASS_SIGNER_CERT_PEM_B64=<base64 of signerCert.pem>
APPLE_PASS_SIGNER_KEY_PEM_B64=<base64 of signerKey.pem>
APPLE_PASS_WWDR_PEM_B64=<base64 of wwdr.pem>

# APNs
APPLE_APNS_KEY_ID=<10-char Key ID>
APPLE_APNS_KEY_FILENAME=AuthKey_<KEYID>.p8
APPLE_APNS_KEY_PEM_B64=<base64 of .p8>
APPLE_BUNDLE_ID=com.gloe.app
```

Code pattern for env-or-file PEM loading (already in `walletPass.ts` / `apns.ts` or add):

```ts
function loadPem(envName: string, filename: string): Buffer {
  const b64 = process.env[`${envName}_B64`];
  if (b64) return Buffer.from(b64, 'base64');
  return readFileSync(join(SECRETS_DIR, filename));
}
```

**⚠️ Clerk production instance — social OAuth credentials (easy to miss):** the dev instance runs on Clerk's *shared* OAuth credentials, so social sign-in "just works" today. A production Clerk instance requires **our own credentials for every provider** or each button errors at tap. **Providers are Apple + Google ONLY (decided 2026-06-12):** Facebook + TikTok disabled in Clerk config and removed from the mobile button row — fewer prod credential chores, less sign-in choice paralysis; add back post-launch only if demanded. Prod creds needed: **Apple** (Services ID + Team ID + Key ID + `.p8` from the dev portal — bundle with the Apple Pay portal session; GLO-9), **Google** (Cloud Console OAuth client). The prod instance also prompts for `clerk.gloe.app` DNS records. Same providers on web and app **on purpose** — an Apple-on-iPhone signup must be able to open the same account on gloe.app (one Clerk user pool; provider identity matches across surfaces). **Auth identifiers: email + password only — leave Username OFF** (decided 2026-06-11; **dev actually had username ON+required — fixed via Clerk CLI 2026-06-12**, `auth_username` now fully off). The app collects no username anywhere (`signUp({ email, password })`); if the prod instance accidentally requires username, every sign-up fails. Match dev's identifier settings exactly — verify with `clerk config pull` → `auth_username`.

**⚠️ Clerk legal consent (GLO-15/35):** ✅ **dev instance DONE (2026-06-12, via Clerk CLI)** — `compliance.legal_consent` enabled with Terms `https://gloe.app/legal/terms` + Privacy `https://gloe.app/legal/privacy`. **At launch, repeat on prod:** `clerk config patch --instance prod --json '{"compliance":{"legal_consent":{"enabled":true,"privacy_policy_url":"https://gloe.app/legal/privacy","terms_of_service_url":"https://gloe.app/legal/terms"}}}'`. (The Clerk CLI is installed globally and the repo is linked to the Gloē app — `clerk auth login` as dev@gettally.io if credentials expire. Verify mobile **social** sign-up on dev still completes with consent required; the email flow already passes `legalAccepted`.) The code is already wired on both platforms: web's prebuilt `<SignUp/>` renders the consent checkbox automatically once the toggle is on, and mobile's `AuthGateSheet` reads the flag via `useClerkLegal()` and passes `legalAccepted: true` (and shows the "By continuing, you agree…" notice with live links either way). Clerk stores the acceptance timestamp on the user — that's the consumer-side acceptance record (vendors additionally get `vendors.terms_accepted_at`/`terms_version` at business signup).

### Phase 5 — Mobile build

18. `apps/mobile/.env`: `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` → `https://api.gloe.app`. Use EAS Secrets for prod Clerk + Stripe publishable keys.
19. EAS `production` profile: release scheme + distribution=store + auto-bump build number.
20. `npx eas build --platform ios --profile production` (~15 min).
21. `npx eas submit --platform ios --profile production` (~30 min Apple processing).

#### OTA updates (expo-updates) — set up HERE, when cutting the first TestFlight build

**Deferred intentionally** (decided 2026-05-30). Not installed yet — `expo-updates` absent, no `eas.json`. Do NOT wire OTA mid-feature-sprint while native code is still churning (Apple Pay, Wallet, iPad/device-family edits) — you're rebuilding anyway, so OTA buys nothing and adds a sharp edge.

When you DO set it up (one-time, ~30 min, do it calmly):
- `npx expo install expo-updates`; add `eas.json` with `development` / `preview` / `production` profiles and matching update **channels**.
- **`runtimeVersion` policy:** set it to `appVersion` (or a fingerprint policy). This is the critical safety: an OTA update whose JS expects native code NOT in the installed build must be *not-delivered*, never delivered-and-crash. Mismatched runtimeVersion = update silently withheld (safe), not a launch crash.
- **Two update types — know which you have:**
  - **JS-only** (UI, copy, most bug fixes, the ComingSoon screen, logger tweaks): `eas update --branch <channel>` → testers get it on next open, **no Apple review, ~1 min**.
  - **Native** (new module, Info.plist/entitlements/capability, SDK bump, device-family/pbxproj change): requires `eas build` → `eas submit` → Apple processing (~30–45 min). OTA CANNOT ship these.
- **Discipline:** push to a `preview` channel first, never straight to `production`. A bad OTA hits everyone instantly. `eas update:rollback` exists; know it before you need it.
- Apple rule: OTA is for changes that don't materially alter the app's purpose. Fine for fixes/polish; a whole new feature should ride a reviewed build.

### Phase 6 — TestFlight

22. **Internal** — yourself + ~5 friends. Test happy path: signup → claim → pay → voucher → redeem (sim) → review. Gift link path. Wallet add.
23. **External** — 20–50 beta users (24h Apple review). Bug-fixes here are far cheaper than post-launch. Once OTA is live, JS-only fixes in this phase ship via `eas update` without a new build/review.

### Phase 7 — App Store submission

24. **App Information** — name "Gloē", subtitle (30 char), categories Lifestyle + Health & Fitness, Free, US only for v1.
25. **Screenshots** — 6.9", 6.5", 5.5" with device frames. Discover, Deal detail, Wallet, Voucher (QR + Wallet badge), Profile.
26. **Description + keywords** — 1700-char benefit-first description. Keywords: aesthetic, beauty deals, botox, filler, spa, medspa, injectables, microneedling, hydrafacial...
27. **Privacy Policy URL** — hosted on gloe.app.
28. **Support URL** — `mailto:hello@gloe.app` or Help page.
29. **Age rating** — 12+.
30. **In-app purchases** — none. App Review note: "Vouchers redeem for in-person aesthetic services at independent businesses. Stripe Connect handles all payments. Apple Pay is offered as a payment method only."
31. **Submit for review** (~24h SLA).

### Phase 8 — Pre-launch checklist (non-code)

- ~~**Landing page at gloe.app**~~ — ✅ obsolete (GLO-16 canceled): gloe.app is the full consumer marketplace (hero, live deals, "Get the app" section, vendor CTA) and is the destination for ads.
- **Transactional email via Resend** — receipts (critical, prevents chargebacks), voucher expiry reminders, vendor welcome, gift-link confirmations.
- **Push notifications** — contextual asks (after first save or purchase, not cold). 60–80% opt-in vs. 20% cold.
- **ToS + Privacy via Termly** ($15–50/mo). Critical clauses: "Gloē is a marketplace facilitator, not a service provider," "vendors are independent licensed providers," "all services subject to consultation," refund window (3 days goodwill), arbitration, vendor indemnification.
- **Customer support email** — ImprovMX (free forwarding) → Google Workspace ($6/mo) at volume. `hello@gloe.app` everywhere.
- **First 5 real vendors** — walk-in pitch (30% conversion vs. 0.5% cold email). Take photos. Help word the deal. White-glove onboarding. Proof-point: send first customer yourself.
- **Analytics** — Mixpanel free tier (100k events/mo). Funnel: discover → detail → checkout → paid → redeemed.
- **Error monitoring** — Sentry free for solo devs. Mobile + API.

### Phase 9 — Day-of-launch monitoring

32. Stripe dashboard — first real transactions visible.
33. Railway logs — 500s in webhook handlers lose money.
34. Supabase advisors — perf or security warnings on real traffic.
35. Sentry — crashes.

### "Launched" definition

5+ live spas. TestFlight approved. Stripe live. Receipts firing. gloe.app marketplace live. ToS + Privacy live. Support email works. Your wife's friend can install and buy.

---

## 12. Manual test scenarios

Critical-path tests. Run before signing the first real spa. ~90 minutes top to bottom.

### Prerequisites

- Clean dev DB
- Test vendor "Test Vendor Spa" with `stripe_account_status='active'`
- Stripe test mode + webhooks listening locally (`stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4000/webhooks/stripe`)
- Auto-balance top-up enabled on Stripe test platform

### Scenario 1 — Happy path

Customer buys $200 deal → Stripe charges platform balance → claim created `status='active'` → vendor scans QR (or dev-redeem) → `status='redeemed'` → auto-release fires Transfer to vendor's Connect ($160 at 20%) → Stripe runs payout.

**Good:** `transactions` shows `released`. `payouts` shows `paid`. Audit log has matching rows.

### Scenario 2 — Manual release

Same as 1 but with `auto_release_on_redemption=false`. Money sits in "Waiting to release" queue. Admin clicks Push → Transfer fires.

### Scenario 3 — Multi-quantity

Customer buys qty 3 of $80 facial. **One `transactions` row + three `claims` rows**, each independently redeemable. First redemption fires the full vendor payout (known gap — verify intent).

### Scenario 4 — Pre-onboarding vendor

Vendor with `stripe_account_status='pending'`. Customer pays → claim created → vendor tries to release → Transfer is REFUSED. `transactions.status='paid'` (money held). Vendor finishes Stripe → manual retry → Transfer succeeds.

### Scenario 5 — Per-vendor fee override

Admin sets 8% override (vs. global 20%). Subsequent bookings use 8%. Historical bookings unchanged (frozen via `platform_fee_snapshot`).

### Scenario 6 — Voucher expiry

Voucher unredeemed past `expires_at`. Cron flips to `expired`. No transfer fires. Money stays on Gloē balance.

**How long a voucher lives (GLO-29):** the window is the admin-set `voucher_validity_days` in `platform_settings` (god mode → Settings → Voucher validity window; default 90). A deal *may* carry a per-deal `code_validity_days` override — the column is nullable, blank in the posting form = platform default. Changing the setting affects **new** vouchers only; already-issued vouchers keep their stored `expires_at`.

**Reissue an expired voucher (GLO-29):** in god mode's transaction drawer, an expired-and-not-yet-replaced voucher shows **Reissue voucher** (`admin.reissueClaim` → `reissueClaim` in `claims.ts`). It inserts a NEW claim — same user/deal/variant/transaction + frozen snapshot, fresh `qr_payload` + `human_code`, fresh `expires_at` from the current window — linked to the dead one via `reissued_from_claim_id` (unique partial index = one reissue per voucher, even with racing admins). No new charge, no `spots_claimed` bump. Audit row `claim.reissued`; customer gets the `voucher_reissued` push via the notification registry.

### Scenarios 7a–7f — Refunds

7a. Full refund of unredeemed → PaymentIntent refunded, claim cancelled.
7b. Partial refund → claim stays active, transaction.status `partially_refunded`.
7c. Stack partials to full → cumulative refund equals charge.
7d. Refuse refund on redeemed claim → UI hides button + backend rejects.
7e. Refuse refund on insufficient balance.
7f. Idempotency on double-submit.

### Scenarios 8–9 — Payouts

8. Standard payout: Stripe runs daily ACH → `payout.paid` webhook → `payouts` row updated.
9. Failed payout: use Stripe test routing `110000000` → `payout.failed` → red banner in vendor Hub.

### Scenarios 10–13 — Instant payouts

10. Happy path: vendor opts in + has debit card → tap "Pay me now" for $176 → 3% fee → debit gets $170.72 in ~30 min.
11. Opted in, no debit card: orange callout, no button.
12. $0 available: no button offered.
13. Not opted in: server refuses.

### Scenarios 14–17 — Edges

14. Fee tier overlap: admin can't create overlapping ranges.
15. Historical immutability: editing a fee tier doesn't retroactively change past bookings.
16. Vendor suspension: deals drop to draft. Held payouts still pushable if Stripe active.
17. Reconciliation: manual DB vs. Stripe diff catches drift.

### Launch-day sign-off (the 4 must-pass)

| # | Test | What good looks like |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Refunds | Full, partial, refused-on-redeemed all behave |
| 2 | Standard payout | `payout.paid` webhook fires, admin shows updated amounts |
| 3 | Failed payout | `payout.failed` fires, red banner appears |
| 4 | Vendor onboarding | Connect → webhook flips status → make test purchase + payout cycle |

All 4 green = ready to sign first real spa.

---

## 13. Operating the system day-to-day

### "Vendor says I haven't been paid"

1. Admin → Vendors → find them → check payouts tab.
2. Filter to last 7d. Status: pending? in_transit? paid? failed?
3. If failed → check failure_message → red banner already showed in their Hub.
4. If pending → standard ACH cadence (1–2 biz days). Wait.
5. If no payouts at all → check Stripe account status. `pending`? They haven't finished onboarding. Send them the link.

### "Customer says I was charged but no voucher"

1. Admin → Transactions → find by email or PaymentIntent ID.
2. Status `pending_payment`? Webhook didn't fire. Check Stripe Dashboard → Events. Replay it.
3. Status `paid` but no claim? `fulfillPurchase()` failed. Check Railway logs.
4. Issue refund (status will revert) or manually create claim with audit note.

### Reconciling Stripe vs. our books

1. Admin → Payouts → "Reconcile" button → runs `reconcileVendorTransfers()`.
2. Discrepancies surface in UI.
3. Common drift causes: missed webhook (replay), idempotency collision (manual investigation), manual Stripe Dashboard action (audit note).

### Releasing a held payout

1. Vendor on `auto_release_on_redemption=false` → claim redeemed → money waiting.
2. Admin → that claim's transaction → "Release transfer" button.
3. All 11 walls re-checked. Audit row written.

### Handling failed payout

1. `payout.failed` webhook → `payouts.status='failed'` + `failure_message` set.
2. Vendor Hub shows red banner.
3. Admin → "Retry failed payout" once vendor fixes bank info.

### Test-mode quirks

- Pending balance in test mode never settles → payouts will sit "pending" forever unless you top up the Stripe test balance.
- Bypass cards: `4000 0000 0000 0341` for instant fund, `4000 0000 0000 9995` for insufficient.
- Routing `110000000` to force payout failure.

## 14. Roadmap (v1 → v4)

### v1.0 — MVP San Diego (now)

- Consumer iOS app (**iPhone only** — `supportsTablet:false`; iPad support is a v2.0 item), vendor portal, admin, Stripe Connect, Apple Pay, Apple Wallet pass.
- 5 launch vendors, 25+ deals across 3–4 categories.
- gloe.app consumer marketplace website.
- US only.

### v1.1 — Polish

- ~~**Robust DoorDash-style search**~~ — ✅ **shipped early** (2026-06-01). Fuzzy + synonym-aware, location-ranked, auto-tagging, inventory-gated drill-down. See §6A. Tail: search logging, FilterSheet sort/rating UI, "open now".
- Map tab in consumer app (deals plotted by location).
- Reviews (write side; read is shipped).
- Apple Wallet live status updates (Pass Web Service + APNs trigger).
- ~~Delete account UI~~ — ✅ shipped (§6).
- Contextual location ask. (ATT prompt only if/when an ads/attribution SDK ships — see §10.)
- Sentry + Mixpanel.

### v1.2 — Engagement

- Push notifications on flash deals, saved-vendor activity, voucher expiry.
- Referrals (Gloē credit on signup).
- Credit / loyalty system live.

### v1.3 — Monetization (vendor-side optional)

- Promoted posts / sponsored placement.
- Vendor analytics dashboard.

### v2.0 — Scale

- Multi-city (LA, NYC, Austin, Miami).
- Android.
- **iPad — native tablet support.** v1 ships iPhone-only (`supportsTablet:false`, device family `1`). Real iPad support means adaptive layouts + landscape across Discover / Deal detail / Voucher / Map, not just scaled-up portrait. Pairs naturally with web consumer browse (shared responsive work).
- Web consumer browse.
- Apple Wallet App Clip (save-deal-from-link without install).

### v3.0 — Network effects

- Gloē Plus subscription (free shipping-equivalent: priority deals, exclusive %).
- Concierge (chat-based booking).
- Vendor-to-vendor referrals.

### v4.0 — Platform

- Public API / white-label.
- B2B partnerships (hotels, gyms, plastic surgery centers).
- In-home / mobile aesthetic deals.

---

## 15. Legal & compliance

- **Marketplace facilitator language** in ToS. Gloē is not a service provider.
- **Vendor indemnification** clause — they own clinical outcomes.
- **License verification** — ✅ built (GLO-19): vendors submit license # + state + type + document; admin verifies against the state board lookup and approves/rejects in god-mode. The verification *decision* is still a human checking the board site — eventually automate via state board API where available.
- **Medical disclaimers** — results not guaranteed; consultation required; vendor attestation that customer is a candidate.
- **HIPAA** — Gloē is NOT a covered entity. Do not collect PHI. Keep claim metadata to vendor + product, never diagnosis or treatment specifics.
- **FTC fake review rules** — only verified buyers can review. Flag vendor for review manipulation.
- **State aesthetic advertising laws** — vary by state. Lawyer's job.
- **Insurance** — general + cyber + E&O. State money transmitter check (some states require licenses for marketplaces holding funds; Stripe Connect "destination charges" pattern usually avoids this — confirm with counsel).
- **Stripe Connect** handles KYC, 1099-K, payouts, refunds.

## 16. Infrastructure & costs

### 🚨 Region co-location (the #1 prod-perf rule)

Supabase is in **`aws-1-us-east-1`** (Virginia). **Railway MUST deploy in the same region (us-east).** A SoCal dev laptop → us-east DB pays ~83ms per query round-trip (measured), which makes things feel slow in dev — but that's a dev artifact: co-located in prod, each query is ~1–3ms. **Pick the Supabase region first, pin Railway to match — never split coasts.** The DB pool (`db/client.ts`) keeps connections warm 5 min (`idle_timeout: 300`) + a boot `SELECT 1`, so a paused tap doesn't re-pay the ~1s TLS handshake. For local dev speed, run a local Postgres (`supabase start`) to avoid the cross-country hop entirely. Stay on the transaction pooler (`:6543`, `prepare:false`).

### Year 1 (San Diego pilot)

- Railway API + web: ~$25/mo
- Supabase Pro: $25/mo
- Cloudflare DNS: free
- Resend (transactional email): free tier → $20/mo at scale
- Termly (ToS + Privacy): $15/mo
- Mixpanel: free tier
- Sentry: free for solo dev
- Stripe: 2.9% + 30¢ per charge (passthrough; not Gloē cost)
- Google Maps: pay-as-you-go, currently low usage
- Apple Developer: $99/yr

**Total infra: ~$100/mo. Marketing budget: $5–8K for the first 6 months.**

### Year 2 (5 cities, ~700 vendors)

- Railway: $200–500/mo (vertical scaling)
- Supabase: $599/mo (Team) or hand-roll to Neon/RDS
- Google Maps: ~$300/mo → switch to Starter plan at $100/mo when crossing 20k calls/mo. See `google-maps-pricing.md`.
- Self-host OSRM routing (~$15/mo) replaces Google Distance Matrix on margin pressure.
- Email scales linearly with vendor + claim count.

### Google Maps pricing crossover (as of 2026-05-24)

| Plan | $/mo | Monthly calls |
|---|---|---|
| Pay-as-you-go | varies | unlimited at ~$5/1k |
| Starter | $100 | 50k |
| Essentials | $275 | 100k |
| Pro | $1,200 | 250k |

Stay on pay-as-you-go today. Switch at $80/mo billing.

## 17. Out of scope (for now)

- In-app messaging (consumer ↔ vendor) — phone + email enough at v1.
- Loyalty points (separate from credit) — credit covers the use case.
- Social features (friends, follow) — not the wedge.
- AI recommendations — manual curation works at scale 1.
- Gloē Plus subscription — v3+.
- B2B partnerships — v4+.
- In-home / mobile service — v4+.
- Web consumer browse — v2.
- Translations — v2.
- Android — v2.

## 18. FAQ — common confusions

### How does Stripe know what Gloē takes?

It depends on the fee type.
- **Platform fee (currently 20% up to $500, flat $60 above — admin-set):** Stripe knows nothing. We compute it, transfer less. The customer is charged $200, we transfer $160, the $40 stays on Gloē's platform balance.
- **Instant payout fee (3%):** Stripe knows. Configured as a pricing scheme in the Stripe Dashboard, auto-deducted during every Connect instant payout under the platform.

### Why does the vendor's dashboard show $160, not $200?

They see what's transferred to *their* account. The $200 customer charge happened on Gloē's platform balance — vendor has no visibility into it. They see $160 arrive via Transfer (at the current 20% fee), then payout. The math (their gross vs. what they received) is shown in their Hub.

### If the money already left our hands on instant payout, how can we charge a 3% fee?

The 3% comes off the *vendor's* available balance during the instant payout itself, not from Gloē's balance. Stripe collects it as an application fee and deposits it into our platform balance.

### Can a misrouted Transfer ever send money to the wrong vendor?

No, because **routing is derived server-side**. The vendor ID on a claim is set at claim creation from the deal's vendor. `releaseTransferForClaim()` looks up `vendor.stripe_account_id` server-side, never trusts the caller. Even an authenticated admin can't redirect a transfer to a different account.

### Why are there two FKs on the claims ↔ transactions relationship?

`transactions.claim_id` is historical / informational. The authoritative direction is `claims.transaction_id`. A multi-quantity purchase produces one transaction + N claims, so the transaction-side claim_id is meaningless after qty>1 — kept for legacy.

### Pay Type ID vs. Bundle ID — what topic does APNs use?

APNs has two topics:
- **In-app pushes:** topic = bundle ID (`com.gloe.app`).
- **Wallet pass pushes:** topic = Pass Type ID (`pass.com.gloe.voucher`).

Each uses a different signing key but the same `.p8` works for in-app pushes today.

### Why don't we use Google Distance Matrix for drive times?

At $0.005 per origin × destination pair, a 50-card feed costs $0.25 per user per day even cached. That scales linearly with users and outruns platform fee margin fast.

DoorDash and Uber don't pay Google for routing — they self-host OSRM. We currently use a straight-line estimate × tiered-mph model (within ±20% of Google). When margin demands, we'll switch to self-hosted OSRM. See `osrm-self-hosted-routing-todo.md`.

### Why two iOS apps eventually (consumer + vendor)?

Different mental models (browse vs. operate), different login systems (Clerk consumer vs. vendor), different native capabilities (no QR camera in consumer), different App Store discovery, different release cadence (vendor can ship faster — no consumer review risk), different security review scope.

Today: vendor lives in `apps/web/src/app/vendor` (responsive web). Native vendor app is a deferred v1.3+ enhancement, not a launch blocker.

### Why one monorepo despite two-or-three frontends?

Code sharing (api-client, ui, brand) without npm publishing. One git history. One `npm install`. One CI pipeline (eventually).
