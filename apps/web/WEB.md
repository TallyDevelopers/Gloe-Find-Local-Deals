# Gloē Web — Consumer Marketplace (source of truth)

> Living build tracker for turning `gloe.app` into a customer-facing marketplace
> that works on phones and computers. **Updated at the end of every phase.**
> Companion to the root `GLOE.md` (which has the product/business overview).

Last updated: 2026-06-02 · All phases (0–4) complete + desktop redesign + iteration polish. **Merged to `main` and deployed via Railway.** See "Shipped log" and "Known gaps" at the end.

## The idea

`gloe.app` is **consumer-first**. The site root `/` is the marketplace (browse →
claim/pay → wallet/redeem). Businesses reach their portal through a **"For
Businesses"** link → `/business` → `/vendor` (existing portal). Admin stays at
`/admin`. The mobile app and the website share **one tRPC API** (`apps/api`) and
one design language (warm rose-gold light theme — Fraunces display + Inter body).

Design north star: **gorgeous, editorial, premium.** Light mode only (v1).

---

## Architecture (how the website is built)

- **Next.js 15 App Router**, web-native React (no react-native-web). Styling =
  CSS variables (`src/app/globals.css`) + inline styles, same as the existing
  business pages.
- **Route group `(consumer)`** holds every shopper page and a shared
  `layout.tsx` that renders the consumer shell (top nav on desktop, bottom tab
  bar on mobile). Business/admin/vendor live outside the group, so they keep
  their own chrome.
- **Data**: `trpc` (already wired in `src/lib/TrpcProvider.tsx`, Clerk token
  attached). Public procedures for browsing, protected (Clerk) for
  saved/wallet/account. Full reuse — see API map below.
- **Auth**: Clerk. Consumer sign-in returns the shopper to where they were
  (default `/`); business sign-in still lands on `/vendor`.
- **Payments**: Stripe-hosted Checkout via `checkout.createHostedCheckout`
  (added for web). "Share to pay" reuses `checkout.createGiftLink`.

## Route map

| Route | Group | Auth | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | consumer | public | Phase 1 |
| `/search` | consumer | public | Phase 1 |
| `/deals/[id]` | consumer | public (SEO) | Phase 1 |
| `/spa/[id]` | consumer | public (SEO) | Phase 1 |
| `/treatments/[slug]` | consumer | public (SEO) | category listing — real route so Back works; header + subtype chips + sort |
| `/saved` | consumer | Clerk | Phase 2 |
| `/wallet`, `/wallet/[id]` | consumer | Clerk | Phase 2 |
| `/account` | consumer | Clerk | Phase 2 |
| `/support`, `/support/[id]` | consumer | Clerk | Phase 4 |
| `/business` | business | public | Phase 0 (moved from `/`) |
| `/vendor/*` | business | Clerk | exists |
| `/admin/*` | admin | Clerk+admin | exists |
| `/gift/[sessionId]` | public | none | exists |

Note the `/vendor` collision: the consumer storefront is **`/spa/[id]`** (the
business dashboard owns `/vendor`).

---

## API surface reused (all in `apps/api`)

- **Browse (public):** `deals.list` `deals.search` `deals.suggest`
  `deals.trending` `deals.byId` `deals.categoryTreatments` ·
  `vendors.storefront` `vendors.byId` · `categories.list` · `reviews.listForVendor`
  · `maps.staticMapUrl` `maps.directions` · `geocode.autocomplete`
  `geocode.placeDetails`
- **Account (Clerk):** `saved.listIds/toggle` `saved.listVendors/toggleVendor` ·
  `claims.list/byId` · `me.whoami/deleteAccount` · `reviews.create/byClaim` ·
  `support.*`
- **Pay (Clerk):** `checkout.createGiftLink` (exists) +
  `checkout.createHostedCheckout` (**new, Phase 3**).

Voucher QR payload = `claim.qrPayload` (`gloe:claim:<uuid>`); backup =
`claim.humanCode` (`GLOE-XXXXX`). Redemption is vendor-only (no consumer redeem).

---

## Device-only → web substitutes

PaymentSheet → hosted Checkout · `react-native-qrcode-svg` → `qrcode.react` ·
Apple Wallet `.pkpass` → on-screen QR (v1) · `expo-location` → browser
Geolocation + manual city (`geocode.*`) saved to `localStorage` · maps/tel →
`maps.apple.com` + `tel:` · secure-store → `localStorage` · native Share →
`navigator.share()` + clipboard.

## Build log / checklist

### Phase 0 — Foundation & routing flip ✅ (2026-06-02)
- [x] `WEB.md` (this doc) created
- [x] `/` flipped to consumer (`app/(consumer)/`); business landing → `/business`; middleware updated
- [x] sign-in/sign-up honor `redirect_url` (consumer → `/`, business → `/vendor`)
- [x] consumer shell: `AppShell` / `TopNav` / `MobileTabBar` / `Footer` / `LocationPill`
- [x] `lib/location.tsx` (geolocation + manual fallback + persistence)
- [x] primitives: `DealCard` `CategoryPills` `SaveButton` `icons` `format` `Skeletons` + grid/responsive CSS
- [x] consumer home (`/`) live: hero + search + category filter + deal grid · typecheck clean

### Phase 1 — Browse & discovery (public) ✅ (2026-06-02)
- [x] home feed (`/`) · search (`/search`) · deal detail (`/deals/[id]`) · spa storefront (`/spa/[id]`)
- [x] deal detail: gallery + thumbs, variant picker, sticky purchase panel (desktop) / inline (mobile), provider, static map, reviews, fine print
- [x] all routes return 200 · web + api typecheck clean

### Phase 2 — Account-gated ✅ (2026-06-02)
- [x] `/saved` (Deals + Spas tabs) · `/wallet` (+ `?purchased=1` banner) · `/wallet/[id]` (QR via `qrcode.react`) · `/account`
- [x] `SignInGate` fallback; middleware hard-gates `/saved` `/wallet` `/account` (Clerk `auth.protect()`)
- [x] web typecheck clean · NOTE: gated routes 404 to cookie-less curl (Clerk protect-rewrite) — render fine in-browser

### Phase 3 — Checkout ✅ backend + flow (2026-06-02)
- [x] `checkout.createHostedCheckout` (API) + migration `payment_source IN (…, 'web')`
- [x] Buy now → hosted Stripe Checkout; Share to pay → `createGiftLink`; `useBuy` hook + `PurchasePanel`
- [ ] NOTE: set `PUBLIC_WEB_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000` on the API for local success/cancel redirects (defaults to prod `gloe.app`)

### Phase 4 — Support, SEO, PWA polish ✅ (2026-06-02)
- [x] legal pages (`/legal/terms`, `/legal/privacy`) — placeholder copy, replace before launch
- [x] dynamic sitemap (home/search/business/legal/auth + live deal + spa URLs from API); `/robots.txt` + `/sitemap.xml` whitelisted in middleware
- [x] PWA manifest + icons verified installable
- [x] support threads (`/support` list+compose, `/support/[id]` thread+reply); linked from account + footer
- [x] SSR + `generateMetadata` for deal + spa (server wrapper + client island via `lib/serverApi.ts`) — real `<title>`/OG/Twitter tags

### Desktop redesign ✅ (2026-06-02) — "computer vibes" / ResortPass-style
- [x] inline nav search (`NavSearch`) + top-right "For Businesses" entrance
- [x] home reworked: value-forward hero + single editorial image (no stacked collage), photo "Browse by treatment" cards, a rail per category (Injectables/Skin/Laser/Peptides…), how-it-works band, closing CTA — one feed query grouped client-side
- [x] **treatments are real routes** (`/treatments/[slug]`) → browser Back works; + visible Back on deal/spa pages
- [x] **desktop filter rail** on treatment pages: sticky sidebar (sub-treatment, price, discount, distance, rating) + sort + live count; `ListingFilters` component
- [x] **mobile = app vibes**: filter rail collapses to a slide-up drawer; marketing bands (how-it-works, CTA) hidden on mobile so the home reads like the native feed. **Desktop = full website.**
- [ ] remaining nice-to-haves: real testimonials/press strip, attachments on support replies, replace legal placeholder copy

## How to run / verify

```bash
# API on :4000, then:
npm run dev --workspace=@gloe/web      # http://localhost:3000
npm run typecheck --workspace=@gloe/web
```

Browse `/`, `/deals/[id]`, `/spa/[id]`, `/search` signed-out. Sign in → save →
`/saved`; `/wallet` shows scannable QR. Resize to phone width → bottom tab bar +
single-column grid; desktop → top nav + multi-column.

## Shipped log (post-Phase-4 iteration — 2026-06-02)

Chronological polish after the core build, all on `main`:

- **Desktop-first redesign** — inline nav search (`NavSearch`), top-right "For
  Businesses" entrance; home reworked into a destination: value-forward hero +
  single editorial image, photo "Browse by treatment" cards, a rail per category
  with **"View all" end-cards** (clickable title too), how-it-works band, "Get
  the app" band, closing CTA.
- **Treatments are real routes** (`/treatments/[slug]`) — fixes browser Back +
  shareable/indexable. Visible Back on deal & spa pages too.
- **Data-driven filter rail** (`ListingFilters`) on treatment pages — options are
  derived from the deals actually present (inventory-gated, with live counts;
  shown only when `0 < count < total`). Nothing hardcoded per category; filters
  "pop up" as vendors list. Sticky sidebar on desktop → slide-up drawer on mobile.
- **Mobile = app vibes, desktop = full website** — marketing bands hidden on
  mobile; bottom tab bar only there.
- **Saved + Wallet are signed-in-only** in the nav + tab bar; signed-out users
  get a Sign in entry instead (no redirect walls).
- **Share-to-pay** reworked into a device-aware sheet (`SharePayModal`): native
  share where supported (iOS/Mac), copyable link + Text/Email + explicit
  "Copied!" on PC; warm explanation of what it is.
- **Warm location banner** (`LocationBanner`) when no location is set → one-tap
  "Use my location"; feed re-ranks by distance once set.
- **"Get the app" band** (`GetTheApp`) — faithful in-CSS iPhone render (dynamic
  island, status bar, header, search, category pills, deal cards with real
  photos + rating/reviews/distance/time, bottom tabs, home indicator) + **App
  Store badge only** (iOS-first; Play removed). Phone hidden on small screens.
- **Business profile reachable** — the storefront (`/spa/[id]`) existed but its
  link was invisible; added a tappable **business row** on the deal page
  (avatar + name + city + "View business profile" + chevron) and a branded hero
  placeholder for vendors without a hero image.
- **Sticky purchase panel** on the deal page (grid item + `align-self:start`).
- **Copy is on-brand medspa** (injectables/fillers/facials/laser/skin/peptides) —
  removed "massage"/"deep tissue"/"hair"/"brows" from all consumer + SEO text.

## Deployment

- **PR #1** (`feat/consumer-web-marketplace`) → **merged to `main`**.
  Subsequent polish pushed directly to `main`. Railway builds the service(s)
  watching `main`.
- **Railway env — Web** (`@gloe/web`, `next build` / `next start -p 3000`):
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`.
- **Railway env — API**: `PUBLIC_WEB_ORIGIN` = public web origin (drives Stripe
  success/cancel redirects; defaults to `https://gloe.app`).
- ⚠️ A **Railway web service for `apps/web`** must exist (root dir `apps/web`).
  The `payment_source 'web'` migration is already applied + idempotent.

## Known gaps / next (not blocking)

- **Vendor full profile editor** — vendors can self-edit only description /
  website / Instagram / hours (`vendor.myProfile`). Hero photo, logo, amenities,
  providers are still admin/onboarding-set. Build a full Business Profile editor
  in the vendor portal if self-serve is wanted.
- **App Store badge** links to `#` — swap in the real URL once live.
- Real testimonials/press strip on home; photo **attachments on support replies**;
  replace **placeholder legal copy** before launch.
- SSR is metadata-only (client islands hydrate data) — fine, but could move
  deal/spa initial data server-side for first-paint if needed.
